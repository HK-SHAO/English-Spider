sat with my friend in well known coffee shop in neighboring town of venice as we enjoyed our coffee man called the waiter and placed his order two cups of coffee one on the wall we got interested and observed that he was served with one cup of coffee but he paid for two as soon as he left the waiter attached piece of paper to the wall saying cup of coffee similar occasions took place twice while we were there it seemed that this gesture was quite normal at this place however it was something unique and confusing for us after few days when we again enjoyed coffee there man entered the way this man was dressed did not match the standard or the atmosphere of this coffee shop poverty was evident from his looks as he seated himself he looked at the wall and said one cup of coffee from the wall the waiter served coffee to this man with respect and dignity the man had his coffee and left without paying we were amazed to watch all this when the waiter took off piece of paper from the wall and threw it in the dustbin now it was no surprise for us the matter was very clear the great respect for the needy shown by people in this town moved us to tears coffee is not necessity however the point is that when we take pleasure in any blessing maybe we also need to think about those people who also appreciate that specific blessing but cannot afford note the waiter who gets the communication going between the affording and the needy with smile on his face think about the man in need he enters the coffee shop without having to lower his self dignity he has free cup of coffee without asking or knowing about who has given this cup of coffee to him he only looked at the wall placed an order for himself enjoyed his coffee and left besides we need to remember the role played by the wall that reflects the generosity and care of people in this town what made the author interested as well as confused the waiter making normal gestures customers buying coffee for the needy the waiter attaching coffee orders on the wall customers paying for coffee and having it put on the wall the author thought the man in need was obviously poor not properly dressed not right to leave without paying strange to order coffee from the wall in the author opinion coffee is necessary in our life blessing some can afford respect shown for the needy blessing everyone should have the passage is mainly concerned about learning from the waiter buying coffee for others caring more about the people in need analyzing the characters in the coffee shop most teenagers in britain receive pocket money from their parents report by the bank of scotland interviewed over young people in britain and found that get pocket money different families give different amounts of pocket money the average for eight to fifteen year olds in the uk is about week children in scotland receive slightly more than the national average and londoners get the most teenagers logically get more money than younger children some fifteen to nineteen year olds receive more than month the report found that many children save at least quarter of their weekly pocket money and that more boys than girls save their money lots of young people have to do housework to get their pocket money they help at home with jobs like cleaning and cooking part time job is choice for teenagers who don have pocket money or who want to earn extra money about of teenagers have job popular part time jobs for teenagers include delivering newspapers shop work and working in restaurant or caf there are strict government laws about working hours only children over can work there are some exceptions for example for actors on school day they can work maximum of hours day but not during school hours at weekends and during school holidays they can work longer hours the national minimum wage for people aged is per hour year olds must earn minimum of there isn national minimum waged for people under in britain some children and teenagers have bank account there is no legal age limit at which you can open bank account but bank manager can decide whether to allow child or young person to open an account parents can put pocket money directly into their child bank account and then children can use it to pay for things without carrying money saving or spending pocket money working part time and dealing with banks are all parts of the process of becoming financially independent adult and having to earn and look after your own money the pocket money for child in scotland per week may be which of the following is true according to the passage more girls than boys save pocket money children under are not allowed to work most british teenagers have part time job year old can work hours on saturdays the best title of the passage is finance and independence eyes on your pocket money the importance of part time jobs british teenagers and their pocket money in reflecting on the events of my life that have impacted me returned to the night of august found myself in hall in new york city sitting by my mother not at all tired although we had flown the day before and driven five hours to the city for an evening with harry carrie and garp charity event with readings by three authors the excitement rushing through me kept me awake and thinking was standing and applauding woman as she prepared to read the harry potter series was my gateway to my academic adolescence was so fascinated by the magic world that my mother began taking me to academic conferences focused on the books since have attended presentations about the latin origin of terms and spells the ancient tales and the idea of magic these books opened my eyes to the whole world and to knowledge itself they kept my brain working over the summers more importantly they helped me adopt the ideas useful in school and beyond that there is always another way to do something or to understand an issue with uncertainty and doubt come creative ideas and new ways to look at problems that may result in new different faster and easier solutions and all this came from little magic from book that many people see as series for children also attended lectures about ms rowling ability to beautifully write the story with every small detail connected to something else for example details in books by jonathan swift to chaucer to dickens and austin learned that like all great books rowling stories encouraged connection across mind body and soul although the series has been criticized by those who believe it encourages bad behavior in children was able to hear discussions by those who claimed that these books teach wonderful messages if one gets its deeper meaning it is my generation shared text all college freshmen are familiar with the stories and that gives us set of common beliefs and ideas that help us start to learn new things what did the author do on the night of august he flew for charity event he drove tiredly back home he listened to readings by some authors he enjoyed the excitement of driving the harry potter books led the author to getting jobs in summers studying harder in school writing books for children viewing things in new ways from the lectures the author knew more about story writing skills rowling life stories criticism against books great authors in history what can we know about the author she decides to write similar stories she intends to go to major in writing she doesn have her family support she may continue to read magic stories during these past few days have been reflecting lot on everything that happened this past year and thinking of what can do differently so that the coming year will be much better here want to share some tips so you can also do your resolution and you can achieve them all be realistic you should always try to reach for the skies with your goals but things like want to win the lottery or want to lose pounds in month are things you shouldn have on your list because they will only become frustrations be detailed it lot easier to accomplish more specific plans than general ones instead of writing want to lose weight put things like will start my yes you can diet plan the first monday of the year or will start movement routine times week for minutes when we put down concrete activities we ourselves to them and it becomes lot harder to come up with excuses think of alternatives at the beginning of this past year you put that you were going to start going to the gym as one of your annual plans during the whole year you intended to take action but you always said that you couldn because you came home so tired from work if this is one of your plans for this year you should write down how you re going to achieve it for example will start going to the gym in the mornings before work that way you prevent what stopped you from achieving your goal last year focus on goals which depend on you it is very important that all of your plans are for you to accomplish and it is important that you write them down that way if one of your goals this coming year is to improve relationship with one of your family members make sure that you clearly put down what you are going to do for this to succeed for example will call my sister at least three times week and will visit her in the middle of the year well hope that you use these tips so that this year you will accomplish everything you want and make it the best year ever thank you for being with me during everything this past year and hope that you keep showing me all of this love and support during the next happy new year why isn want to win the lottery recommended as new year plan because it is very likely to fail because it is too easy to realize because it is not big enough as goal because it is not easier than losing weight the underlined word commit in paragraph can be replaced by the word devote determine adjust force when you failed to accomplish your plan last year you re advised to take action instead of writing it down give up the same plan this year put down the way to realize it stop making any plans according to the passage which of the following is the best plan will become millionaire in one month want to be the champion of the marathon will change all of my bad habits in one week will go for walk after supper in working days hours year like you all my email goes into my sent mailbox just sitting there if want to check back at what said to whom years ago so what surprise to see that send approximately emails each year roughly day assuming minutes per email that about hours year on email alone ve been on email since the early the answer is both yes and no yes have been able to keep in touch with family friends and colleagues in far away corners of the planet with ease but while these undoubted benefits are the reasons why continue to email it is not without its own cost most importantly as the above analysis shows email eats my time just as it likely eats yours each time message arrives there just the chance that it might contain something exciting something new something special new opportunity that just enough to keep me checking my inbox but that means perhaps only of the hours spent on emails this year were actually wanted frequent emailmessages will certainly affect our real work like other potentialaddictions we should perhaps attempt to check the email box at certain times ofthe day or by creating email free zones by turning off wi fi now need tothink whether really want to be spending hours year on email at theexpense of more valuable activities was that time well spent all this feeds my continued use of email do you spend hours on emailsevery year and we allrecognize that email has its addictive side email uses technology to communicate digital message over theinternet maybe one in emails contain something really want to know or hear about becoming aware of what email isdoing to our allocation of time is the

of students and parents at high school as to this we hold heated discussion the other day there are two different viewpoints about them some think it necessarily firstly with cellphones students would have focused their attention on studying instead of wasting their precious time reading junk message secondly the examination will be fair if no one cheats by using cellphones however the others don think so for one thing at the age of information cellphones have become necessity for another students can use cellphones for study personal speaking even if some students use cellphones for no good reason we should educate them more than destroy cellphones in such an extreme way even as write this story am still smiling the past few weeks have been rather but when large number of smile cards

my parents where going but what if ask and they say no ll end up wishing never mentioned it and just went ahead and did it anyway if you want more privileges it best to build track record of honesty and trust letting parent know where you re going is always good idea you may worry that telling your parents puts you at risk of getting no for an answer but there good chance your parents might be ok with you going if you go but don tell them you risk losing something more important your parents trust parents who find out their kids did something behind their backs may be less likely to give permission to do things in the future when trust is broken like this parents wonder if teens are trying to hide something and what they imagine can be far worse than the reality before you talk to your parents about the game think about which approach will help them feel most comfortable with giving you more freedom maybe they like to meet the person driving or talk to friends who have driven with her in the past if your parents have questions or hesitate about letting you go find out what their worries are and then do your best to answer them from paragraph we know that the writer appears nervous looks worried feels confused seems discouraged what is the best way to get parents permission according to the passage to get more privileges from them to risk gaining their permission to keep off the track of reality to be honest and win their trust what does the writer really want to tell us how to win over parents how to deal with strict parents which effective approach to use how to get freedom from parents who do you think the passage is intended for parents friends drivers teenagers what are you feeling right now as you start to read this are you curious hope that you ll learn something about yourself bored because this is something you have to do for school and you re not really into it or happy because it school project you enjoy perhaps you re attracted by something else like feeling excited about your weekend plans or sad because you just went through breakup emotions like these are part of human nature they give us information about what we re experiencing and help us know how to react we sense our emotions from the time we re babies young children react to their emotions with facial expressions or with actions like laughing or crying they feel and show emotions but they don yet have the ability to name the emotion or say why they feel that way as we grow up we become more skilled in understanding emotions instead of just reacting like little kids do we can identify what we feel and put it into words with time and practice we get better at knowing what we are feeling and why this skill is called emotional awareness emotional awareness helps us know what we need and want or don want it helps us build better relationships that because being aware of our emotions can help us talk about feelings more clearly avoid or settle conflicts better and move past difficult feelings more easily some people are naturally more in touch with their emotions than others the good news is that everyone can be more aware of their emotions it just takes practice but it worth the effort emotional awareness is the first step toward building emotional intelligence skill that can help people succeed in life what can we learn from paragraph types of emotions the topic to discuss part of human nature ways to react to things how do young children react to emotions with laughter and shouts with signs and expressions with gestures of different kinds with facial expressions and actions from the passage we know that emotional awareness actually enables us to live in society more easily lets people understand others better brings about conflicts between people smooths away difficulties in our life where is the passage probably taken from science fiction an advertisement science magazine television show though for many of us the year ahead may look pretty depressing promises one great breakthrough major step toward ending africa particular and backward form of the great digital divide poor connectivity has bedeviled much of the continent internet access but now huge improvement is coming it new sub sea cable to be laid off africa eastern coastline enabling reliable and affordable international connectivity service to both coastal and landlocked countries in eastern central and southern africa the project is being developed by liquid sea an offshore branch of liquid telecom which already runs pan african network based on land cable supported by satellite links for rural and remote areas altogether with offices from south africa and botswana in the south to kenya in the east taking in democratic republic of congo in the center it makes up the continent largest single connecting network crossing multiple national borders africa has benefited in many ways from the digital revolution but internet coverage still differs from place to place and the unpleasant truth is that despite some great advance in african development over the last decade and more its effects are unequal and taken as whole less than percent of africans have access to the internet which compares that with percent of europeans and percent of north americans it obvious what disadvantage is placed upon africans by such digital inequality the economics of the entire process is skewed by poor network performance in africa with the total bandwidth available to shuttle data back and forth between african countries and the rest of the world amounting to less than terabit per second that about one seventieth of europe international bandwidth capacity now liquid sea underwater cable stretching from eastern south africa to the middle east with onward connections to europe aims to contribute much more in building africa better connected digital future what does bedeviled most probably mean in paragraph attracted troubled worsened contributed what would the internet be like in africa in the future dependable and inexpensive accessible and comfortable central and controllable possible and comparable what is implied in the passage international bandwidth capacity makes no difference internet connections improve the equality in africa poor internet access limits the economy of africa africa is now far beyond developed countries which of the following is the best title for the passage unsafe internet access in africa digital gap narrowing in africa bandwidth available in africa great digital divide in africa here are some of the best tv

them even have their inspiration because they have got used to articles from computers there is no doubt that have made great contribution to improving our of life making it easier and more convenient

younger than years old often speakers at meeting experience dry mouths and ask for glass of water you can solve the problem by activating the saliva in you mouth first gently bite the edges of your tongue with your teeth or press your entire tongue to the bottom of your mouth and hold it there until the saliva flow or you can imagine that you are slicing big juicy lemon and sucking the juice before you begin your talk be kind to your voice avoid milk or creamy drinks which coat your throat keep your throat wet by drinking little sweetened warm tea or water down fruit juice if you sense that you are losing your voice stop talking completely save your voice for your speech you may feel foolish using paper to write notes but the best thing you can do is to rest your voice if you feel the need to see doctor perhaps getting some advice from professional singer can be better choice in the meantime do not even talk in low voice what about drinking alcohol to wet your throat advise you not to touch alcohol before speaking the problem with alcohol is that one drink gives you little confidence the second drink gives you even more confidence finally you will feel all powerful and you will feel you can do everything but in fact your brain and your mouth do not work together properly save the alcohol until after you finish speaking perhaps you want to accept the advice but you may wonder if you can ever change the habits of lifetime of course you can goethe who lived before indoor skating rinks or swimming pools said we learn to skate in the summer and swim in the winter take this message to heart and give yourself time to develop your new habits if you are willing to change you will soon be able to say that you will never forget these techniques because they ve become part of your body which of the following things does the writer suggest that you should do before you began your talk drink water down fruit juice have some drink with cream have some cool milk have high tea what does the writer suggest when you feel you are losing your voice going to see doctor asking professional singer for help whispering the things that you want to say keeping on talking rather than use paper to write notes according to the text what will happen to your speech when you drink alcohol your face will be redder and more shining your mouth and thought will not be in line you will be so confident as to carry out your speech perfectly well you will get excited enough to attract people attention in the speech what is the purpose of the writer to use goethe words to encourage one to go in for sports to tell that goethe had strong willpower to prove one can change his habits to remind people of the techniques to develop lifelong habits for centuries mankind and dogs have suffered from communication failure we can tell dogs what we want them to do and sometimes they comply but we ve always struggled when it comes to understanding the true meaning of their barks and whimpers there is exciting news now dog translator has been invented to help you communicate with your furry friend researchers at north carolina state university have some kind of miracle dog translator body harness what special about it is that it doesn just rely on the dog vocalizations to interpret what fido is banging on about oh no this miracle harness reads and interprets the ordinary dogs body language as well giving us full two way dog communication experience researcher david roberts says dogs communicate primarily through body language and one of our challenges was to develop sensors that tell us about their behavior by observing their posture remotely sensors on the harness monitor the dog heart rate and body temperature and software builds up vocabulary letting the human know what the dog is feeling what would dogs say if they could talk to us the human can even communicate back through the harness thanks to vibration motors supposedly by tapping into the dog senses so that it can understand what you re trying to say to it the dog harness is designed for dogs involved in search and rescue and other front line work but it got us dreaming of beautiful future one where humans and dogs can co exist as equals with the dog able to fully express itself at all times why can people communicate with dogs they have difficulty understanding dogs barks and whimpers they have no idea about dogs behavior in relation to their posture they don know how to tell dogs what they want them to do they don have machine to translate the dogs language what does the underlined word most probably mean in paragraph two pursue fashion research influence make for what purpose is the dog harness designed it is designed for dogs to understand what people are trying to say to them it is designed to monitor the dog heart rate and body temperature it is designed for dogs doing search and rescue and other front line work itis designed to monitor the dog heart rate and body temperature what is the author attitude towards the possible human dog communication shocked excited embarrassed annoyed the medical world is gradually realizing that the quality of the environment in hospitals may play significant role in the process of recovery from illness as part of nationwide effort in britain to bring art out of the galleries and into public places some of the country most talented artists have been called in to transform older hospitals and to soften the hard edges of modern buildings of the national health service hospitals in britain almost now have significant collections of contemporary art in corridors waiting areas and treatment rooms these recent initiatives owe great deal to one artist peter senior who set up his studio at manchester hospital in northeastern england during the early he felt the artist had lost his place in modern society and that art should be enjoyed by wider audience typical hospital waiting room might have as many as visitors each week what better place to hold regular exhibitions of art senior held the first exhibition of his own paintings in the out patients waiting area of the manchester royal hospital in believed to be britain first hospital artist senior was so much in demand that he was soon joined by team of six young art school graduates the effect is striking now in the corridors and waiting rooms the visitor experiences full view of fresh colors playful images and restful courtyards the quality of the environment may reduce the need for expensive drugs when patient is recovering from an illness study has shown that patients who had view onto garden needed half the number of strong pain killers compared with patients who had no view at all or only brick wall to look at according to the passage to soften the hard edges of modern buildings means to pull down hospital buildings to decorate hospitals with art collections to improve the quality of treatment in hospitals to make the corners of hospital buildings round according to peter senior art is not as important in people daily life as in hospital art galleries should be changed into hospitals patients should be encouraged to learn painting art should be encouraged in british hospitals after the improvement of the hospital environment patients no longer need expensive drugs in their recovery patients are less dependent on expensive drugs in their recovery patients need good quality drugs in their recovery patients use fewer pain killers in their recovery than before the fact that senior is in great demand shows that peter enterprise is developing greatly peter senior enjoys great popularity he is talented hospital artist the role of hospital environment is being recognized practical ways to get motivated be

exist if it weren for casual conversation small talk is the grease for social communication says bernardo carducci director of the shyness research institute at indiana university southeast almost every great love story and each big business deal begins with small talk he explains the key to successful small talk is learning how to connect with others not just communicate with them in study

necessary the results showed that those who chatted with their server reported significantly higher positive feelings and better coffee shop experience it not that talking to the waiter is better than talking to your husband says dunn but interactions with peripheral members of our social network matter for our well being also dunn believes that people who reach out to strangers feel significantly greater sense of belonging bond with others carducci believes developing such sense of belonging starts with small talk small talk is the basis of good manners he says what phenomenon is described in

asked her to move to san antonio to help their children she politely refused only after year of friendly discussion did ms gaf finally say yes that was four years ago today all three generations regard the move to success giving them closer relationship than they would have had in separate cities no statistics show the number of grandparents like garza who are moving closer to the children and grandchildren yet there is evidence suggesting that the trend is growing even president obama mother in law marian robinson has agreed to leave chicago and into the white house to help care for her granddaughters according to study grandparents com percent of the people said mrs robinson decision will influence the grandparents in the american family two thirds believe more families will follow the example of obama family in the we were all little wild and couldn get away from home far enough fsst enough to prove we could do it on our own says christine crosby publisher of grate manazine for grandparents we now realize how important family is and how important to be near them especially when you re raining children moving is not for everyone almost every grandparent wants to be with his or her grandchildren and is willing to make sacrifices but sometimes it is wiser to say no and visit frequently instead having your grandchildren far away is hard especially knowing your adult child is struggling but giving up the life you know may be harder why was garza move success it strengthened her family ties it improved her living conditions it enabled her make more friends it helped her know more new places what was the reaction of the public to mrs robinson decision expressed their support for it few people responded sympathetically believed it had bad influence the majority thought it was trend what did crosby say about people in the they were unsure of raise more children they were eager to raise more children they wanted to live away from their parents they bad little respect for their grandparent what does the author suggest the grandparents do in the lasr paragraph make decisions in the best interests of their own ask their children to pay more visits

woman put peter on first to london to newark to providence to washington the meaning of silence varies among cultural groups silences may be thoughtful or they may be empty when person has nothing to say silence in conversation may also show stubbornness or worry silence may be viewed by some cultural groups as extremely uncomfortable therefore attempts may be made to fill every gap with conversation persons in other cultural groups value silence and view it as necessary for understanding person needs many native americans value silence and feel it is basic part of communicating among people just as some traditional chinese and thai persons do therefore when person from one of these cultures is speaking and suddenly stops what maybe implied is that the person wants the listener to consider what has been said before continuing in these cultures silence is call for reflection other cultures may use silence in other ways particularly when dealing with conflicts among people or in relationships of people with different amounts of power for example russian french and spanish persons may use silence to show agreement between parties about the topic udner discussion however mexicans may use silence when instructions are given by person in authority rather than be rude to that person by arguing with him or her in still another use persons in asian cultures may view silence as sign of respect particularly to an elder or person in authority nurses and other care geivers need to be aware of the possible meanings of silence when they come across the personal anxiety their patients may be expericencing nurses should recognize their own personal and cultural construction of silence so that patient silence is not interrupted too early or allowed to go on unnecessarily nurse who understands the healing value of silence can use this understanding to assist in the care of patients from their own and from other cultures what does the author say about silence in conversations it implies anger it promotes friendship it is culture specific it is content based which of the following people might regard silence as call for careful thought the chinese the french the mexicans the russians what does the author advise nurses to do about silence let it continue as the patient pleases break it while treating patients evaluate its harm to patients make use of its healing effects what may be the best title for the text sound and silence what it means to be silent silence to native americans speech is silver silence is gold secret codes keep messages private banks companies and government agencies use secret codes in doing business especially when information is sent by computer people have used secret codes for thousands of years code breaking never lags far behind code making the science of creating and reading coded messages is called cryptography there are three main types of cryptography for example the first letters of my elephant eats too many eels spell out the hidden message meet me you might represent each letter with number for example let number the letters of the alphabet in order from to if we substitute number for each letter the message meet me would read code uses symbols to replace words phrases or sentences to read the message of real code you must have code book for example bridge might stand for meet and out might stand for me the message bridge out would actually mean meet me however it is also hard to keep code book secret for long so codes must be changed frequently it is very hard to break code without the code book in any language some letters are used more than others only people who know the keyword can read the message as long as there have been codes people have tried to break them you can hide message by having the first letters of each word spell it out with code book you might write down words that would stand for other words another way to hide message is to use symbols to stand for specific letters of the alphabet heroic driver larry works with transport drivers inc one morning in larry was along north after delivering to one of his suddenly he saw car with its bright lights

still unwilling to play the games for them sometimes didn realize how right my parents are until entered high school the games my parents taught me where was child turned out to be very useful later in my life growing together in the year charles dickens was born there were novels published in britain people had been writing novels for century most experts date the first novel to robinson crusoe in but nobody wanted to do it professionally the steam powered printing press was still in its early stages the literacy rate in england was under many works of fiction appeared without the names of the authors often with something like by lady novels for the most part were looked upon as silly immoral or just plain bad in when dickens died the world mourned him as its first professional writer and publisher famous and beloved who had led an explosion in both the publication of novels and their readership and whose characters from oliver twist to tiny tim were held up as moral touchstones today dickens greatness is unchallenged removing him from the pantheon of english literature would make about as much sense as the louvre selling off the mona lisa how did dickens get to the top for all the feelings readers attach to stories literature is numbers game and the test of time is extremely difficult to pass some novels were published during the victorian age from to today casual reader might be able to name half dozen of them it partly true that dickens style of writing attracted audiences from all walks of life it partly that his writings rode wave of social political and scientific progress but it also that he rewrote the culture of literature and put himself at the center no one will ever know what mix of talent ambition energy and luck made dickens such singular writer but as the th anniversary of his birth approaches it is possible and important for our own culture to understand how he made himself lasting one which of the following best describes british novels in the th century they were difficult to understand they were popular among the rich they were seen as nearly worthless they were written mostly by women dickens is compared with the mona lisa in the text to stress his reputation in france his interest in modern art his success in publication his importance in literature what is the author purpose in writing the text to remember great writer to introduce an english novel to encourage studies on culture to promote values of the victorian age steven stein likes to follow garbage trucks his strange habit makes sense when you consider that he an environmental scientist who studies how to reduce litter including things that fall off garbage trucks as they drive down the road what is even more interesting is that one of stein jobs is defending an industry behind the plastic shopping bags americans use more than billion thin film plastic bags every year so many end up in tree branches or along highways that growing number of cities do not allow them at checkouts the bags are prohibited in some cities in california including los angeles eyeing these plastic bag makers are hiring scientists like stein to make the case that their products are not as bad for the planet as most people assume among the bag makers argument many cities with bans still allow shoppers to purchase paper bags which are easily recycled but require more energy to produce and transport and while plastic bags may be ugly to look at they represent small percentage of all garbage on the ground today the industry has also taken aim at the product that has appeared as its replacement reusable shopping bags the stronger reusable bag is the longer its life and the more plastic bag use it cancels out however longer lasting reusable bags often require more energy to make one study found that cotton bag must be used at least times to be better for the planet than plastic environmentalists don dispute these points they hope paper bags will be banned someday too and want shoppers to use the same reusable bags for years what has steven stein been hired to do help increase grocery sales recycle the waste material stop things falling off trucks argue for the use of plastic bags what does the word headwinds in paragraph refer to bans on plastic bags effects of city development headaches caused by garbage plastic bags hung in trees what is disadvantage of reusable bags according to plastic bag makers they are quite expensive replacing them can be difficult they are less strong than plastic bags producing them requires more energy what is the best title for the text plastic paper or neither industry pollution and environment recycle or throw away garbage collection and waste control as cultural symbols go the american car is quite young the model ford was built at the piquette plant in michigan century ago with the first rolling off the assembly line on september only eleven cars were produced the next month but eventually henry ford would build fifteen million of them modern america was born on the road behind wheel the car shaped some of the most lasting aspects of american culture the roadside diner the billboard the motel even the hamburger for most of the last century the car represented what it meant to be american going forward at high speed to find new worlds the road novel the road movie these are the most typical american ideas born of abundant petrol cheap cars and never ending interstate highway system the largest public works project in history in herbert hoover imagined an america with chicken in every pot and car in every garage since then this society has moved onward never looking back as the car transformed america from farm based society into an industrial power the cars that drove the american dream have helped to create global ecological disaster in america the demand for oil has grown by percent since the problems of excessive energy consumption climate change and population growth have been described in book by the american writer thomas friedman he fears the worst but hopes for the best friedman points out that the green economy is chance to keep american strength the ability to design build and export green technologies for producing clean water clean air and healthy and abundant food is going to be the currency of power in the new century why is hamburger mentioned in paragraph to explain americans love for travelling by car to show the influence of cars on american culture to stress the popularity of fast food with americans to praise the effectiveness of america road system what has the use of cars in america led to decline of economy environmental problems shortage of oil supply farm based society what is friedman attitude towards america future ambiguous doubtful hopeful tolerant moving into new home in new neighborhood is an exciting experience of course you want to make sure that you become an acceptable and valuable part of

find some id so he could contact the driver only to it contained in notes with another in spare change beside it he then took the wallet to nearby police station after note behind to let the owner know it was safe when the car owner john anderson and his colleague carol lawrence returned to the car which was itself worth in glasgow city centre they were to find two policemen standing next to it the policemen told them what mr smith did and that the wallet was the pair were later able to thank mr smith for his mr anderson said couldn believe that the guy never took penny to think he is

just proves there are guys out there mr smith act much of the public attention he also won praise from social media users after mr anderson about the act of kindness on facebook now mr anderson has

injured and this meant not running for two weeks leaving me only two weeks to train yet was determined to go ahead remember back to my th year in school in my first class the teacher required us to run laps and then hit softball didn do either well he later informed me that was not athletic the idea that was not athletic stuck with me for years when started running in my realized running was battle against myself not about competition or whether or not was athletic it was all about the battle against my own body and mind test of wills the night before my marathon dreamt that couldn even find the finish line woke up sweating and nervous but ready to prove something to myself shortly after crossing the start line my shoe laces became untied so stopped to readjust not the start wanted at mile passed sign go for it runners by mile became out of breath and the once injured ankle hurt badly despite the pain stayed the course walking bit and then running again by mile was starving as approached mile could see my wife waving sign she is my biggest fan she never minded the alarm clock sounding at or questioned my expenses on running was one of the final runners to finish but finished and got medal in fact got the same medal as the one that the guy who came in first place had determined to be myself move forward free of shame and worldly labels can now call myself marathon winner month before the marathon the author was well trained felt scared made up his mind to run lost hope why did the author mention the class in his th year to acknowledge the support of his teacher

than million tons of plastic every year almost half of that winds up in landfills and up to million tons pollute the oceans qso far there is no effective way to get rid of it but new study suggests an answer may lie in the stomachs of some hungry worms researchers in spain and england recently found that the worms of the greater wax moth can break down polyethylene which accounts for of plastics the team left wax worms on commercial polyethylene shopping bag for hours and the worms consumed and broke down about milligrams or almost of it to confirm that the worms chewing alone was not responsible for the polyethylene breakdown the researchers made some worms into paste and applied it to plastic films hours later the films had lost of their mass apparently broken down by enzymes from the worms stomachs their findings were published in current biology in federica bertocchini co author of the study says the worms ability to break down their everyday food beeswax also allows them to break down plastic wax is complex mixture but the basic bond in polyethylene the carbon carbon bond is there as well she explains the wax worm evolved method or system to break this bond jennifer debruyn microbiologist at the university of tennessee who was not involved in the study says it is not surprising that such worms can break down polyethylene but compared with previous studies she finds the speed of breaking down in this one exciting the next step debruyn says will be to identify the cause of the breakdown is it an enzyme produced by the worm itself or by its gut microbes bertocchini agrees and hopes her team findings might one day help employ the enzyme to break down plastics in landfills but she expects using the chemical in some kind of industrial process not simply millions of worms thrown on top of the plastic what can we learn about the worms in the study they take plastics as their everyday food they are newly evolved creatures they can consume plastics they wind up in landfills according to jennifer debruyn the next step of the study is to identify other means of the breakdown find out the source of the enzyme confirm the research findings increase the breakdown speed it can be inferred from the last paragraph that the chemical might help to raise worms help make plastic bags be used to clean the oceans be produced in factories in future what is the main purpose of the passage to explain study method on worms to introduce the diet of special worm to present way to break down plastics to propose new means to keep eco balance preparing cities for robot cars the possibility of self driving robot cars has often seemed like futurist dream years away from materializing in the real world well the future is apparently now the california department of motor vehicles began giving permits in april for companies to test truly self driving cars on public roads the state also cleared the way for companies to sell or rent out self driving cars and for companies to operate driverless taxi services california it should be noted isn leading the way here companies have been testing their vehicles in cities across the country it hard to predict when driverless cars will be everywhere on our roads but however long it takes the technology has the potential to change our transportation systems and our cities for better or for worse depending on how the transformation is regulated while much of the debate so far has been focused on the safety of driverless cars and rightfully so policymakers also should be talking about how self driving vehicles can help reduce traffic jams cut emissions and offer more convenient affordable mobility options the arrival of driverless vehicles is chance to make sure that those vehicles are environmentally friendly and more shared do we want to copy or even worsen the traffic of today with driverless cars imagine future where most adults own individual self driving vehicles they tolerate long slow journeys to and from work on packed highways because they can work entertain themselves or sleep on the ride which encourages urban spread they take their driverless car to an appointment and set the empty vehicle to circle the building to avoid paying for parking instead of walking few blocks to pick up child or the dry cleaning they send the self driving minibus the convenience even leads fewer people to take public transport an unwelcome side effect researchers have already found in ride hailing services study from the university of california at davis suggested that replacing petrol powered private cars worldwide with electric self driving and shared systems could reduce carbon emissions from transportation and cut the cost of transportation infrastructure and operations by fewer emissions and cheaper travel sound pretty appealing the first commercially available driverless cars will almost certainly be by ride hailing services considering the cost of self driving technology as well as liability and maintenance issues but driverless car ownership could increase as the prices drop and more people become comfortable with the technology policymakers should start thinking now about how to make sure the appearance of driverless vehicles doesn extend the worst aspects of the car controlled transportation system we have today the coming technological advancement presents chance for cities and states to develop transportation systems designed to move more people and more affordably the car of the future is coming we just have to plan for it according to the author attention should be paid to how driverless cars can help deal with transportation related problems provide better services to customers cause damage to our environment make some people lose jobs as for driverless cars what is the author major concern safety side effects affordability management what does the underlined word fielded in paragraph probably mean employed replaced shared reduced what is the author attitude to the future of self driving cars doubtful positive disapproving sympathetic why do we get angry anger seems simple when we are feeling it but the causes of anger are various knowing these causes can make us examine our behavior and correct bad habits the main reasons we get angry are triggering events personality traits and our assessment of situations triggering events for anger are so many that to describe them all would take hundreds of pages however here are some examples being cut off in traffic deadline approaching experiencing physical pain and much more the reason why someone is triggered by something and others are not is often due to one personal history and psychological traits each person no matter who they are has psychological imbalances people who have personality traits that conncct with competitiveness and low upset tolerance are much more likely to get angry also sometimes pre anger does not have to do with lasting condition but rather temporary state before triggering event has occurred sometimes even routine occurrences become sources of pre anger or anger itself sometimes ignorance and negative outlooks on situations can create anger however anger can easily turn violent and it is best to know the reasons for anger to appear in order to prevent its presence with these main reasons in mind we can evaluate our level of anger throughout the day and prevent cases of outbursts by comprehending the reasons for our feelings our attitude and viewpoint on situations can create anger within us as well but some types of situations can help us to get rid of the occurrence of anger anger is rarely looked upon as beneficial character trait and is usually advised to reduce it anger is particularly strong feeling and maybe people think that they have reasons to feel angry having these personality traits implies the pre anger state where anger is in the background of your mind understanding these reasons will control our own anger if we are willing to evaluate ourselves with critical eye not everyone acts the same in response to events and that is why what triggers one person may or may not trigger another jim dear jim yours li hua fgead washington bicycle tours cherry blossom bike tour in washington duration tour this small group bike tour is fantastic way to see world famous cherry

title for the text keeping fit by eating smart balancing our daily diet making yourself perfect chef cooking well for less we may think we re culture that gets rid of our worn technology at the first sight of something shiny and new but new study shows that we keep using our old devices well after they go out of style that bad news for the environment and our wallets as these outdated devices consume much more energy than the newer ones that do the same things to figure out how much power these devices are using callie babbitt and her colleagues at the rochester institute of technology in new york tracked the environmental costs for each product throughout its life from when its minerals are mined to when we stop using the device this method provided readout for how home energy use has evolved since the early devices were grouped by generation desktop computers basic mobile phones and box set tvs defined digital cameras arrived on the scene in and mp players smart phones and lcd tvs entered homes in before tablets and readers showed up in as we accumulated more devices however we didn throw out our old ones the living room television is replaced and gets planted in the kids room and suddenly one day you have tv in every room of the house said one researcher the average number of electronic devices rose from four per household in to in we re not just keeping these old devices we continue to use them according to the analysis of babbitt team old desktop monitors and box tvs with cathode ray tubes are the worst devices with their energy consumption and contribution to greenhouse gas emissions more than doubling during the to window so what the solution the team data only went up to but the researchers also explored what would happen if consumers replaced old products with new electronics that serve more than one function such as tablet for word processing and tv viewing they found that more on demand entertainment viewing on tablets instead of tvs and desktop computers could cut energy consumption by what does the author think of new devices they are environment friendly they are no better than the old they cost more to use at home they go out of style quickly why did babbitt team conduct the research to reduce the cost of minerals to test the life cycle of product to update consumers on new technology to find out electricity consumption of the devices which of the following uses the least energy the box set tv the tablet the lcd tv the desktop computer what does the text suggest people do about old electronic devices stop using them take them apart upgrade them recycle them color is fundamental in home design something you ll always have in every room grasp of how to manage color in your spaces is one of the first steps to creating rooms you ll love to live in do you want room that full of life professional or are you just looking for place to relax after long day color is the key to making room feel the way you want it to feel over the years there have been number of different techniques to help designers approach this important point they can get little complex but good news is that there re really only three kinds of decisions you need to make about color in your home the small ones the medium ones and the large ones they re the little spots of color like throw pillows mirrors and baskets that most of us use to add visual interest to our rooms less tiring than painting your walls and less expensive than buying colorful sofa small color choices bring with them the significant benefit of being easily changeable medium color choices are generally furniture pieces such as sofas dinner tables or bookshelves they require bigger commitment than smaller ones and they have more powerful effect on the feeling of space the large color decisions in your rooms concern the walls ceilings and floors whether you re looking at wallpaper or paint the time effort and relative expense put into it are significant while all of them are useful whatever you re looking for if you re experimenting with color small color choices are the ones we re most familiar with it not really good idea to use too many small color pieces so it pays to be sure because you want to get it right the first time color choices in this range are step up from the small ones in two major ways badgf by boat is the only way to get here which is we arrived where when why how kids shouldn have access to violent films because they might the things they see indicate investigate imitate innovate self driving is an area

mathurin roze opened series of shops that boasted special meat soup called consomme although the main attraction was the soup roze chain shops also set new standard for dining out which helped to establish roze as the inventor of the modern restaurant today scholars have generated large amounts of instructive research about restaurants take visual hints that influence what we eat diners served themselves about percent more pasta when their plates matched their food when dark colored cake was served on black plate rather than white one customers recognized it as sweeter and more tasty lighting matters too when berlin restaurant customers ate in darkness they couldn tell how much they had those given extra large shares ate more than everyone else but were they didn feel fuller and they were just as ready for dessert time is money but that principle means different things for different types of restaurants unlike fast food places fine dining shops prefer customers to stay longer and spend one way to encourage customers to stay and order that extra round put on some mozart when classical rather than pop music was playing diners spent more fast music hurried diners out particular scents also have an effect diners who got the scent of lavender stayed longer and spent more than those who smelled lemon or no scent meanwhile things that you might expect to discourage spending bad tables crowding high prices don necessarily diners at bad tables next to the kitchen door say spent nearly as much as others but soon fled it can be concluded that restaurant keepers need not be overly concerned about bad tables given that they re profitable as for crowds hong kong study found that they increased restaurant reputation suggesting great food at fair prices and doubling buffet price led customers to say that its pizza was percent tastier the underlined phrase none the wiser in paragraph most probably implies that the customers were not aware of eating more than usual not willing to share food with others not conscious of the food quality not fond of the food provided how could fine dining shop make more profit playing classical music introducing lemon scent making the light brighter using plates of larger size what does the last paragraph talk about tips to attract more customers problems restaurants are faced with ways to improve restaurants reputation common misunderstandings about restaurants if you want to disturb the car industry you better have few billion dollars mom and pop carmakers are unlikely to beat the biggest car companies but in agriculture small farmers can get the best of the major players by connecting directly with customers and by responding quickly to changes in the markets as well as in the ecosystems small farmers can keep one step ahead of the big guys as the co founder of the national young farmers coalition nyfc and family farmer myself have front row seat to the innovations among small farmers that are transforming the industry for example take the quick cut greens harvester tool developed just couple of years ago by young farmer jonathan dysinger in tennessee with small loan from local slow money group it enables small scale farmers to harvest pounds of green vegetables per hour huge improvement over harvesting just few dozen pounds by hand suddenly making it possible for the little guys to compete with large farms of california before the tool came out small farmers couldn touch the price per pound offered by california farms but now with the combination of better price point and generally fresher product they can stay in business the sustainable success of small farmers though won happen without fundamental changes to the industry one crucial factor is secure access to land competition from investors developers and established large farmers makes owning one own land unattainable for many new farmers from to agricultural land values doubled and they continue to rise in many regions another challenge for more than million of the most qualified farm workers and managers is non existent path to citizenship the greatest barrier to building farm of their own with farmers over the age of outnumbering farmers younger than by six to one and with two thirds of the nation farmland in need of new farmer we must clear the path for talented people willing to grow the nation food there are solutions that could light path toward more sustainable and fair farm economy but farmers can clumsily put them together before us we at the nyfc need broad support as we urge congress to increase farmland conservation as we push for immigration reform and as we seek policies that will ensure the success of diverse and ambitious next generation of farms from all backgrounds with new farm bill to be debated in congress consumers must take stand with young farmers the author mentions car industry at the beginning of the passage to introduce the progress made in car industry special feature of agriculture trend of development in agriculture the importance of investing in car industry what does the author want to illustrate with the example in paragraph loans to small local farmers are necessary technology is vital for agricultural development competition between small and big farms is fierce small farmers may gain some advantages over big ones what is the difficulty for those new famers to gain more financial aid to hire good farm managers to have farms of their own to win old farmers support what should farmers do for more sustainable and fair farm economy seek support beyond nyfc expand farmland conservation become members of nyfc invest more to improve technology children as young as ten are becoming dependent on social media for their sense of self worth major study warned it found many youngsters now measure their status by how much public approval they get online often through likes some change their behaviour in real life to improve their image on the web the report into youngsters aged from to was carried out by children commissioner anne longfield she said social media firms were exposing children to major emotional risks with some youngsters starting secondary school ill equipped to cope with the tremendous pressure they faced online some social apps were popular among the children even though they supposedly require users to be at least the youngsters admitted planning trips around potential photo opportunities and then messaging friends and friends of friends to demand likes for their online posts the report found that youngsters felt their friendships could be at risk if they did not respond to social media posts quickly and around the clock children aged to were starting to feel happy when others liked their posts however those in the to age group were concerned with how many people like their posts suggesting need for social recognition that gets stronger the older they become miss longfield warned that generation of children risked growing up worried about their appearance and image as result of the unrealistic lifestyles they follow on platforms and increasingly anxious about switching off due to the constant demands of social media she said children are using social media with family and friends and to play games when they are in primary school but what starts as fun usage of apps turns into tremendous pressure in real social media interaction at secondary school as their world expanded she said children compared themselves to others online in way that was hugely damaging in terms of their self identity in terms of their confidence but also in terms of their ability to develop themselves miss longfield added then there is this push to connect if you go offline will you miss something will you miss out will you show that you don care about those people you are following all of those come together in huge way at once for children it is very very difficult to cope with emotionally the children commissioner for england study life in likes found that children as young as were using social media platforms largely for play however the research involving eight groups of children aged to suggested that as they headed toward their teens they became increasingly anxious online by the time they started secondary school at age children were already far more aware of their image online and felt under huge pressure to ensure their posts were popular the report found however they still did not know how to cope with mean spirited jokes or the sense of incompetence they might feel if they compared themselves to celebrities or more brilliant friends online the report said they also faced pressure to respond to messages at all hours of the day especially at secondary school when more youngsters have mobile phones the children commissioner said schools and parents must now do more to prepare children for the emotional minefield they faced online and she said social media companies must also take more responsibility they should either monitor their websites better so that children do not sign up too early or they should adjust their websites to the needs of younger users javed khan of children charity barnardo said it vital that new compulsory age appropriate relationship and sex education lessons in england should help equip children to deal with the growing demands of social media it also hugely important for parents to know which apps their children are using why did some secondary school students feel too much pressure they were not provided with adequate equipment they were not well prepared for emotional risks they were required to give quick responses they were prevented from using mobile phones some social app companies were to blame because they didn adequately check their users registration they organized photo trips to attract more youngsters they encouraged youngsters to post more photos they didn stop youngsters from staying up late children comparing themselves to others online may lead to less friendliness to each other lower self identity and confidence an increase in online cheating stronger desire to stay online according to life in likes as children grew they became more anxious to circulate their posts quickly know the qualities of their posts use mobile phones for play get more public approval what should parents do to solve the problem communicate more with secondary schools urge media companies to create safer apps keep track of children use of social media forbid their children from visiting the web what does the passage mainly talk about the influence of social media on children the importance of social media to children the problem in building healthy relationship the measure to reduce risks from social media how arts promote our economy when most people think of the arts they imagine the end product the beautiful painting wonderful piece of music or an award winning performance in the theater but arts groups bring broader value to our communities the economic impact of the arts is often overlooked and badly judged the arts create jobs that help develop the economy any given performance takes tour bus full of artists technical experts managers musicians or writers to create an appealing piece of art these people earn living wage for their professional knowledge and skills another group of folks is needed to help market the event if you build it they will come is misleading belief painters digital media experts photographers booking agents and promoters are hired to sell tickets and promote the event according to the dallas area cultural advocacy coalition arts agencies employ more than people as full or part time employees or independent contractors successful arts neighborhoods creates ripple effect throughout community in when the bishop arts theatre was donated to our town the location was considered poor area of town after investing more than million in reconstructing the building we began producing full season of theater performances jazz concerts and year round arts education programs in nearly percent of jazz lovers live outside of the dallas city limits and drive or fly in to enjoy an evening in the bishop arts district no doubt the theater has contributed to the area development and economic growth today there are galleries studios restaurants and newly built work spaces where neighbors share experiences where there is renewed life and energy in this way arts and culture also serve as public good teco theatrical productions inc made use of bloomberg investment of to get nearly in public and private sector support during the two year period further dallas arts and arts based businesses produce for every dollar the city spends on arts programming and facilities in philadelphia metro area smaller than dallas the arts have an economic impact of almost million and support jobs percent of which actually lie outside the arts industry including accountants marketers construction workers hotel managers printers and other kinds of art workers the arts are efficient economic drivers and when they are supported the entire small business community benefits it is wrong to assume arts groups cannot make profit but in order to stay in business arts groups must produce returns if you are student studying the arts chances are you have been ill advised to have plan but those who truly understand the economic impact and can work to change the patterns can create wide range of career possibilities ratings benefit ways joint collective promotion marketing effect fares positive outside beyond statistics data analyses alternative possible version one as major channel of consumption information the rating is an efficient source of information for shopping in our own consumption interestingly the same rating may have different influences on different consumers tend to consult consumption ratings whatever purchase firstly the higher rating means the higher quality of the product or better service based on the ratings bought my beloved backpack saw interesting films and tasted delicious foods secondly ratings can save time to make decisions in shopping for example there are huge amounts of reference books which am often confused to choose from in that case it is both convenient and economical to buy books according to the ratings there is no doubt that it is unwise to depend completely on the ratings in consumption the advantages and disadvantages of ratings are often closely related it is necessary to hold an

flight yesterday we would be enjoying our holiday on the beach now had caught caught have caught would catch no one is born winner people make themselves into winners by their own learned this lesson from many years ago took the head job at school in baxley georgia it was small school with weak football program it was tradition for the school old team to play against the team at the end of spring practice the old team had no coach and they didn even practice to the game being the coach of the new team was excited because knew we were going to win but to my disappointment we were defeated couldn had got into such situation thinking hard about it came to that my team might not be the number one team in georgia but they were me had to change my about their ability and potential started doing anything could to help them build little most important began to treat them like that summer when the other teams enjoyed their we met every day and passing and kicking the football six months after suffering our on the spring practice field we won our first game and our second and continued to finally we faced the number one team in the state felt that it would be for us even if we lost the game but that wasn what happened my boys beat the best team in georgia giving me one of the greatest of my life from the experience learnt lot about how the attitude of the leader can the members of team instead of seeing my boys as losers pushed and them helped them to see themselves and they built themselves into winners winners are made but born luck tests efforts nature experiment experience visit show operating editing consulting coaching successful excellent strong new cheer for prepare for help with finish with believe agree describe regret realize claim permit demand reacting to looking for depending on caring about decision attitude conclusion intention pride culture fortune relationship leaders partners winners learners rewards vacations health honor risked missed considered practiced defeat decline accident mistake relax improve expand defend shame burden victory favor chances thrills concerns offers surprise serve interest affect encouraged observed protected impressed honestly individually calmly differently when was read magazine article about museum called the mcnay once the home of watercolorist named marian mcnay she had requested the community to turn it into museum upon her death on sunny saturday sally and drove over to the museum she asked do you have the address no but ll recognize it there was picture in the magazine oh stop there it is the museum was free we entered excited group of people sitting in the hall stopped talking and stared at us may help you man asked no said we re fine tour guides got on my nerves what if they talked long time about painting you weren that interested in sally had gone upstairs the people in the hall seemed very nosy keeping their eyes on me with curiosity what was their problem saw some nice sculptures in one room suddenly sensed man standing behind me where do you think you are he asked turned sharply the mcnay art museum he smiled shaking his head sorry the mcnay is on new braunfels street what this place asked still confused well it our home my heart jolted raced to the staircase and called out sally come down immediately there some really good stuff up there she stepped down looking confused pushed her toward the front door waving at the family saying sorry please forgive us you have really nice place outside when told sally what happened she covered her mouth laughing she couldn believe how long they let us look around without saying anything the real mcnay was splendid but we felt nervous the whole time we were there van gogh picasso this time we stayed together in case anything else unusual happened thirty years later woman approached me in public place excuse me did you ever enter residence long ago thinking it was the mcnay museum yes but how do you know we never told anyone that was my home was teenager sitting in the hall before you came over never realized what beautiful place lived in never felt lucky before you thought it was museum my feelings about my home changed after that ve always wanted to thank you what do we know about marian mcnay she was painter she was community leader she was museum director she was journalist why did the author refuse the help from the man in the house she disliked people who were nosy she felt nervous when talking to strangers she knew more about art than the man she mistook him for tour guide how did the author feel about being stared at by the people in the hall puzzled concerned frightened delighted why did the author describe the real mcnay museum in just few words the real museum lacked enough artwork to interest her she was too upset to spend much time at the real museum the mcnay was disappointing compared with the house the event happening in the house was more significant what could we learn from the last paragraph people should have good taste to enjoy life people should spend more time with their family people tend to be blind to the beauty around them people tend to educate teenagers at museum give yourself test which way is the wind blowing how many kinds of wildflowers can be seen from your front door if your awareness is as sharp as it could be you ll have no trouble answering these questions most of us observed much more as children than we do as adults child day is filled with fascination newness and wonder curiosity gave us all natural awareness but distinctions that were sharp to us as children become unclear we are numb to new stimulation new ideas relearning the art of seeing the world around us is quite simple although it takes practice and requires breaking some bad habits the first step in awakening senses is to stop predicting what we are going to see and feel before it occurs this blocks awareness one chilly night when was hiking in the rocky mountains with some students mentioned that we were going to cross mountain stream the students began complaining about how cold it would be we reached the stream and they unwillingly walked ahead they were almost knee deep when they realized it was hot spring later they all admitted they felt cold water at first another block to awareness is the obsession many of us have with naming things saw bird watchers who spotted bird immediately looked it up in field guides and said ruby crowned kinglet and checked it off they no longer paid attention to the bird and never learned what it was doing the pressures of time and destination are further blocks to awareness encountered many hikers who were headed to distant camp ground with just enough time to get there before dark it seldom occurred to them to wander bit to take moment to see what around them asked them what they seen oh few birds they said they seemed bent on their destinations nature seems to unfold to people who watch and wait next time you take walk no matter where it is take in all the sights sounds and sensations wander in this frame of mind and you will open new dimension to your life according to paragraph compared with adults children are more anxious to do wonders sensitive to others feelings likely to develop unpleasant habits eager to explore the world around them what idea does the author convey in paragraph to avoid jumping to conclusions to stop complaining all the time to follow the teacher advice to admit mistakes honestly the bird watchers behavior shows that they are very patient in their observation are really fascinated by nature care only about the names of birds question the accuracy of the field guides why do the hikers take no notice of the surroundings during the journey the natural beauty isn attractive to them they focus on arriving at the camp in time the forest in the dark is dangerous for them they are keen to see rare birds at the destination in the passage the author intends to tell us we should fill our senses to feel the wonders of the world get rid of some bad habits in our daily life open our mind to new things and ideas try our best to protect nature

day winter market cities usually have good reason for being where they are like nearby port or river people settle in these places because they are easy to get to and naturally suited to communications and trade new york city for example is near large harbour at the mouth of the hudson river over years its population grew gradually from people to million but not all cities develop slowly over long period of time boom towns grow from nothing almost overnight in dawson canada was unmapped wilderness but gold was discovered there in and two years later it was one of the largest cities in the west with population of dawson did not have any of the natural conveniences of cities like london or paris people went there for gold they travelled over snow covered mountains and sailed hundreds of miles up icy rivers the path to dawson was covered with thirty feet of wet snow that could fall without warming an avalanche once closed the path killing people for many who made it to dawson however the rewards were worth the difficult trip of the first people who dug for gold got rich about of these stayed rich men for the rest of their lives but no matter how rich they were dawson was never comfortable necessities like food and wood were very expensive but soon the gold that dawson depended on had all been found the city was crowded with disappointed people with no interest in settling down and when they heard there were new gold discoveries in alaska they left dawson city as quickly as they had come today people still come and go to see where the canadian gold rush happened tourism is now the chief industry of dawson city its present population is what attracted the early settlers to new york city its business culture its small population its geographical position its favourable climate what do we know about those who first dug for gold in dawson two thirds of them stayed there one out of five people got rich almost everyone gave up half of them died what was the main reason for many people to leave dawson they found the city too crowded they wanted to try their luck elsewhere they were unable to stand the winter they were short of food what is the text mainly about the rise and fall of city the gold rush in canada journeys into the wilderness tourism in dawson while famous foreign architects are invited to lead the designs of landmark buildings in china such as the new cctv tower and the national center for the performing arts many excellent chinese architects are making great efforts to take the center stage their efforts have been proven fruitful wang shu year old chinese architect won the pritzker architecture prize which is often referred to as the nobel prize in architecture on february he is the first chinese citizen to win this award wang serves as head of the architecture department at the china academy of art caa his office is located at the xiangshan campus of the university in hangzhou zhejiang province many buildings on the campus are his original creations the style of the campus is quite different from that of most chinese universities many visitors were amazed by the complex architectural space and abundant building types the curves of the buildings perfectly match the rise and fall of hills forming unique view wang collected more than million abandoned bricks of different ages he asked the workers to use traditional techniques to make the bricks into walls roofs and corridors this creation attracted lot of attention thanks to its mixture of modern and traditional chinese elements wang works show deep understanding of modern architecture and good knowledge of traditions through such balance he had created new type of chinese architecture said tadao ando the winner of the pritzker prize wang believes traditions should not be sealed in glass boxes at museums that is only evidence that traditions once existed he said many chinese people have misunderstanding of traditions they think tradition means old things from the past in fact tradition also refers to the things that have been developing and that are still being created he said today many chinese people are learning western styles and theories rather than focusing on chinese traditions many people tend to talk about traditions without knowing what they really are said wang the study of traditions should be combined with practice otherwise the recreation of traditions would be artificial and empty he said wang winning of the prize means that chinese architects are following the latest world trend getting international recognition working harder than ever before relying on foreign architects what impressed visitors to the caa xiangshan campus most its hilly environment its large size its unique style its diverse functions what made wang architectural design success the mixture of different shapes the balance of east and west the use of popular techniques the harmony of old and new what should we do about chinese traditions according to wang spread them to the world preserve them at museums teach them in universities recreate them in practice adults understand what it feels like to be flooded with objects why do we often assume that more is more when it comes to kids and their belongings the good news is that can help my own kids learn earlier than did how to live more with less found the pre holidays good time to encourage young children to donate less used things and it worked because of our efforts our daughter georgia did decide to donate large bag of toys to little girl whose mother was unable to pay for her holiday due to illness she chose to sell few larger objects that were less often used when we promised to put the money into her school fund our kindergarten daughter is serious about becoming doctor for weeks ve been thinking of bigger deeper questions how do we make it habit for them and how do we train ourselves to help them live with need and use less yesterday sat with my son shepherd determined to test my own theory on this decided to play with him with only one toy for as long as it would keep his interest expected that one toy would keep his attention for about five minutes ten minutes max chose red rubber ball simple universally available we passed it he tried to put it in his mouth he tried bouncing it rolling it sitting on it throwing it it was totally completely enough for him before knew it an hour had passed and it was time to move on to lunch we both became absorbed in the simplicity of playing together he had my full attention and had his my little experiment to find joy in single object worked for both of us what do the words more is more in paragraph probably mean the more the better enough is enough more money more worries earn more and spend more what madegeorgia agree to sell some of her objects saving up for her holiday raising money for poor girl adding the money to her fund giving the money to asick mother why did theauthor play the ball with shepherd to try out an idea to show parent love to train his attention to help him start hobby what can be asuitable title for the text take it or leave it lesson from

your brain one possible version it is well known that the task of students is to study so some students regard that marks are very important they think that their primary task is to study and learn from teachers and textbooks they seldom take part in other activities for they are afraid that those activities will affect their study they put marks in the first place thus neglecting the development of practical abilities however some other students think it most important to develop one own practical ability they think that students should not only learn the textbook knowledge what more they should also learn from outside the textbooks they think one own practical ability is of primary importance so they take the chance to develop their own practical ability seriously in my opinion we should first study hard but we should not neglect our own practical ability for when we enter the society we need various abilities without practice it is hard for us to be useful for the

conventional fuel is needed the campus six buildings comfortable some parts of most modern buildings theatres and offices classrooms are more than amply heated by people and lights and sometimes must be air conditioned in winter the technique of heat and redistributing it is heat recover few modern buildings recover but the university system is the first to recover heat some buildings and re use it in along the way pitt has learned great deal about some of its heat producers the student studies the more heat his body male students emit more heat than students and the larger student the more

eating habits make regular physical activity have positive thoughts your brain one possible version it is well known that the task of students is to study so some students regard that marks are very important they think that their primary task is to study and learn from teachers and textbooks they seldom take part in other activities for they are afraid that those activities will affect their study they put marks in the first place thus neglecting the development of practical abilities however some other students think it most important to develop one own practical ability they think that students should not only learn the textbook knowledge what more they should also learn from outside the textbooks they think one own practical ability is of primary importance so they take the chance to develop their own practical ability seriously in my opinion we should first study hard but we should not neglect our own practical ability for when we enter the society we need various abilities

every person it is the question without which life is impossible why do live is there anything in my life that will not be destroyed by my death these are the words of the famous russian writer leo tolstoy many people ask these difficult questions and they struggle to find meaning in their life tolstoy spent his whole life trying to answer difficult questions like these in the leo tolstoy wrote his first stories he wrote about his experiences in the military he also told stories about when he was child he was finally successful he earned respect from many wealthy and intelligent men who talked lot about faith and the meaning of life but soon he found they were proud and they made very bad moral choices he opened school for the children of people who worked on his land they were very poor he wanted to help them because he thought they were more honest than the wealthy people he knew tolstoy learned many things from his workers he respected how they worked hard to provide for their families so in leo tolstoy married young woman named sonya behrs the next years were the best years of tolstoy life it was during this time that he wrote his most famous books war and peace and anna karenina they communicate what he thought was the answer to all his questions humans were supposed to live simple life and take care of their families these works were published and tolstoy became well known writer howcan realize my dream if have one why do wish for anything or do anything he gained lot of inspirations which had great influence on his followingactions his search for answers influenced his writing so in the tolstoy tried different way to find the meaning of life he began tobelieve that marriage and family would give his life meaning come from one of those families where

long may help increase one life exercise is important and don sit too long watching tv is bad but can broaden one horizons stopping watching tv is necessary but hard task the human body is designed to

your school or are you looking for more of college town experience where you meet new people every day are you looking for liberal arts school or more stem science technology engineering and math focused college maybe you want to attend school more specific to what you may want to do in the future like music or art based school another aspect or factor into your decision is the kinds of activities the college offers once you start collecting list of places you are thinking about the next thing to do is to consult your college counselors and start your applications when applying to

along you are in the process will help the college counselors get their job done and make your application success once those applications are in the hardest part comes next waiting as soon as the results come out you will know which school is right for you whether it is your top choice or something else down your list the next step is finding what college suits you academically they also invite students to email any question they may have one of the first things that colleges look at is your past school record this is also the time to reflect on which college you are hoping to get into sports the arts and other interests can be huge part in determining the right school choosing between larger or smaller campus is the first step to narrow down which college is right for you you

yours li hua you know how wonderful you are and you know that others know how wonderful you are but what do you do when admiration crosses over the line into jealousy for most teens there will come day when you realize that one of your friends is jealous and that this jealousy is hurting your friendship when this happens it can seem like there is nothing that you can do but the good news is that there is don t let jealousy spoil your relationships tackle it headon and you might be back to normal much sooner than you think it can be hard to walk up to friend and ask them what the problem is but if you want to save your friendship you ll have to do just that don t approach them and ask why they are jealous of you unless of course you want to appear totally conceited just take some time alone with them and let them know that you ve been feeling like there s been something coming between you if they refuse to respond then use the opportunity to explain how you have been feeling chances are that something you say will strike nerve and your friend will open up as well when you figure out what is annoying your friend ask him or her what s he thinks would make the situation better if for example s he says that s he feels like s he doesn t get to spend any time with you because of your being off with your new friends from tee swim team then maybe you could invite her along the next time or block off one day week for just the two of you remember though that whatever solution you decide on should be compromise don t limit your own talents or opportunities simply because your friend is unhappy try instead to include him or her in your new life and see how that works out even the best of friendships can be tinged by jealousy this destructive emotion is rarely productive and can turn best friends into worst enemies before taking extreme action chat with your jealous friend to see if the two of you can work out compromise if you can t be prepared to know exactly how far you will go to keep your friendand how far you won t according to the author the jealousy emotion is normal productive destructive extreme that this jealousy is hurting your friendship

her what the problem is spending some time with him her and letting him her know how you feel spending some time with him her and letting him her know you think there s something between you don t approach them and ask why they are jealous of you the underlined it in the first paragraph refers to friendship relationship admiration jealousy what can be inferred from the last two paragraphs there s always solution to solve the problem of jealousy jealousy can turn best friends into worst enemies you may lose friend to keep your own gifts chances or self development you should go long way with your friend to work out solution the purpose of the passage is to explain what causes jealousy to offer some advice on making friends to introduce the way to cope with jealous friend to explain how destructive the jealous emotion is do american children still learn handwriting in school in the age of the keyboard some people seem to think handwriting lessons are on the way out of teachers say they are required to teach handwriting but studies have yet to answer the question of how well they are teaching it one study published this year found that about three out of every four teachers say they are not prepared to teach handwriting some teachers are teaching handwriting by providing instruction for minutes day and then other teachers who basically teach it for to minutes day which really for handwriting is pretty much many adults remember learning that way by copying letters over and over again today s thinking is that short periods of practice are better many experts also think handwriting should not be taught by itself instead they say it should be used as way to get students to express ideas after all that is why we write handwriting involves two skills one is legibility which means forming the letters so they can be read the other is fluency writing without having to think about it fluency continues to develop up until high school but not everyone masters these skills teachers commonly report that about onefourth of their kids have poor handwriting some people might think handwriting is not important any more because of computers and voice recognition programs but steve graham at vanderbilt says word processing is rarely done in elementary school especially in the early years american children traditionally first learn to print and then to write in cursive which connects the letters but guess what we learned from spokeswoman for the college board which administers the sat college admission test more than percent of students choose to print their essay on the test rather than write in cursive we can learn from paragraph teaching handwriting is basic requirement in teaching job most teachers prefer to teach handwriting teachers spend little time in teaching handwriting keyboard has taken the place of the handwriting entirely of teachers say they are required to teach handwriting one study published this year found that about three out of every four teachers say they are not prepared to teach handwriting which of the following is wrong for traditional handwriting in the usa the students are taught by practicing long period the letters are repeated many times handwriting includes two skills to write in cursive is taught first the underlined word legibility in paragraph means easy to read complex unexpected unreadable which means forming the letters so they can be read the best title for the passage is how to improve handwriting in school right or wrong the death of handwriting handwriting involves two skills handwriting lessons are on the way out the author s attitude towards whether still to learn handwriting in school is negative objective critical optimistic one study published this year found that about three out of every four teachers say they are not prepared to teach handwriting published this year found they are not prepared to teach handwriting southampton university team found that people who were vegetarians by had recorded five iq points higher on average at the age of researchers said it could explain why people with higher iq were healthier as vegetarian diet was linked to lower heart disease and obesity rates the study of people was reported in the british medical journal twenty years after the iq tests were carried out in of the participants said they were vegetarians although more than reported eating either fish or chicken men who were vegetarians had an iq score of compared with for non vegetarians while female vegetarians averaged compared with for non vegetarians there was no difference in the iq scores between strict vegetarians and those who said they were vegetarians but reported eating fish or chicken researchers said the findings were partly related to better education and higher class but it remained statistically significant after adjusting for these factors vegetarians were more likely to be female to be of higher social class and to have higher academic or vocational qualifications than non vegetarians however these differences were not reflected in their annual income which was similar to that of non vegetarians lead researcher catharine gale said the findings that children with greater intelligence are more likely to report being vegetarians as adults together with the evidence on the potential benefits of vegetarian diet on heart health may help to explain why higher iq in childhood or adolescence is linked with reduced risk of coronary heart disease in adult life but dr frankie phillips of the british dietetic association said it is like the chicken and egg do people become vegetarians because they have very high iq or is it just that they are clever enough to be more aware of health issues what s the result of the research mentioned in the text intelligent children are more likely to become vegetarians later in life children with higher iq are less likely to have heart disease later in life intelligent children tend to belong to higher social class later in life children with healthier heart tend to have higher iq later in life people who were vegetarians by had recorded five iq points higher on average at the age of it could explain why it was found in the research that most of the participants became vegetarians years after the iq tests were carried out vegetarians who ate fish or chicken were of similar intelligence with strict vegetarians female vegetarians were more likely to have higher annual income than non vegetarians vegetarians were more likely to have higher annual income than non vegetarians there was no difference in the iq scores between strict vegetarians and those who said they were vegetarians but reported eating fish or chicken catharine gale talked about being vegetarians in n way doubtful favorable negative objective catharine gale what does the underlined sentence in the last paragraph mean intelligence is linked to not just being vegetarian but to many factors the rate of getting heart disease is linked to your lifestyle the link between high iq and being vegetarian is still uncertain the link between healthy heart and diet remains to be proved dr frankie phillips what s the best title for the text get more iq points be vegetarian please vegetarian diet cuts heart risk high iq is linked to being vegetarian southampton university team found that people who were vegetarians by had recorded five iq points higher on average at the age of who were vegetarians by people there was no difference in the iq scores between strict vegetarians and those who said they were vegetarians but reported eating fish or chicken there was no difference in the iq scores between strict vegetarians and those who said they were vegetarians but reported eating fish or chicken those the hole in the earth s ozone layer has until now protected antarctica from the worst effects of global warming but scientists have warned that as the hole closes up in the next few decades temperatures on the continent could rise by around on average with melting ice contributing to global sea level increase of up to metres in the past decades the western antarctic has seen rapid ice loss as the world has warmed but the other parts of the continent have paradoxically been cooling resulting in increase in ice in the seas around the region this is because the hole in the ozone layer has increased cold winds in antarctica making much of the continent surface colder than usual but now that the gasses that cause the ozone hole have been banned scientists expect the hole to repair itself within the next to years by then the cooling effect will have faded out and the antarctic will face the full impact of global warming this means an increase in average air temperatures of around and reduction in sea ice by around third the biggest threat to the continent comes from warming seas robert johnson scientist who monitors antarctica ice sheets said the ice sheets in antarctica are hundreds of metres thick but once warm ocean waters start flowing underneath the ice will begin thinning and could break up very quickly thinning ice sheets cause ice to break away from the continent and to melt even faster escaping ice from western antarctica has already resulted in rise in global sea level in recent decades johnson believes that international action to reduce global warming is required immediately or it may be too late everything is connected antarctica may be long way away but it is an important part of the earth s system said johnson it contains of the world s ice of the world s fresh water and that is enough if it melts completely to raise sea levels by metres even in worse case situation scientists don t expect the ice to entirely disappear but predict that because of the melting ice sheets average sea level rise will be around metres higher by the end of the century the underlined word paradoxically in paragraph most probably means rapidly approximately contradictorily apparently what is the effect of the hole in the ozone layer on antarctica it is causing the ice to melt faster it is making much of the continent colder it is making the effects of global warming in the region worse it is reducing the amount of water in antarctica what do scientists think is the biggest danger facing antarctica rising sea levels warming sea water temperature water pollution growing ice sheets which of the following is true according to the passage antarctica is currently experiencing the full effects of global warming the average temperature has increased by in recent decades antarctica contains most of the world s fresh water ten percent of antarctica s ice has already been lost the best title for the passage is our planet in danger antarctica melting away action plan to save antarctica let s save the ozone layer we bet that on cold wintry days many of you love to stay in your warm home and every now and then come out into the kitchen for snack unfortunately plenty of creepy crawly critters like to do the same thing winter is the time when bugs invade your house without an invitation the season can be tough for such creatures in winter the air is cold the ground is hard and many trees have no leaves so bugs do what they have to do to survive monarch butterflies head south to warmer climates ants crowd in deep underground colonies and eat food they have been storing all year many insects go into deep sleep called diapauses there re different kinds of diapauses but all are similar to hibernation time when bigger animals become inactive in the cold insects go into an inactive period too but it often isn t when the temperature drops they rely on more dependable signals in the environment for example many insects can tell how much sunlight there s each day they use that to tell themselves when to shut down bugs are cold blooded meaning that their inside temperature is the same as the outside they can t move much when it gets below degrees fahrenheit so they search for any warm place they re looking for protection these guys have been doing this for million years so they don t really know they re coming into your house the home is recent event in terms of their evolutionary behavior they enter through tiny cracks or come in unnoticed on your clothes or shoes remember that they may be invading your homes for warmth and food but they don t care about humans what is the purpose of the first paragraph to point out that humans like to stay at home in winter to mean that humans and bugs have the same living habits to mean that bugs will invade humans houses for their winter to put forward the idea that bugs are not welcome in winter according to the text what is diapauses it is the same as the animals hibernation it often appears in warm areas all the year it is done to keep bugs active in winter it is deep sleep similar to hibernation what often decides bugs diapauses the lower local temperature the amount of sunlight kinds of environmental signals the insects inside temperature they rely on more dependable signals in the environment diapauses according to the text bugs invade humans homes to attack humans look for enough food seek for protection show their evolutionary results what would be the best title for the text bugs life on cold wintry days why do bugs invade your home in winter good relations between humans and bugs what does diapauses mean there re different kinds of diapauses but all are similar to hibernation time when bigger animals become inactive in the cold but but time hibernation when bugs are cold blooded meaning that their inside temperature is the same as the outside meaning which means meaning that the same as july st was typical english summer s day it rained for hours as usual i rushed home from work at midday to check on the house nothing was amiss by the time i left work at pm however the road into our village was flooded our house had never been flooded but as i opened the front door wave of water greeted me thank god the kids weren t with me because the house was feet deep in water we lost everything downstairs and the plaster had to be torn off the walls ceilings pulled down at first we tried to push on through we didn t want to move the children out of home so we camped upstairs we put sheet of plastic across the floor to protect us from the damp but after three months we felt very sick so we moved to wooden house in park the house was small but at first we were all just delighted to be in new place unfortunately things took longer than expected and we were there for months the life there was inconvenient what surprised me most was how much i missed being part of community we had lived in friendly village with good neighbours and i never thought how much i miss that although our situation was very bad it s difficult to feel too sorry for yourself when you look at what s happening elsewhere i watched news report about floods in northern india and thought we didn t have straw hut that was swept away and our house is still standing we re lucky we moved back home in august with december coming there s still reconstruction work to be done so it s difficult to prepare for christmas but i can t wait i m going to throw party for our friends in the village to say thanks for their support this year i won t need any gifts living away from home for months has made me realize how little we actually need or miss all our possessions although we are replacing things there s really no rush we have our home back and that s the main thing what does the underlined word amiss in the first paragraph mean wrong missing right found as usual i rushed home from work it can be inferred from the text that the author was sick of staying upstairs cared much about her children could not stand living in wooden house did not deal well with her family affairs during the flood thank god the kids weren t with me why does the author say that they were lucky in the third paragraph because her situation was not serious because many other places were flooded because she had been to northern india because some others suffered even more what does the author mainly want to express by telling her story she valued human feelings more than before she realized she almost didn t need possessions she found christmas gifts no longer badly needed she thought her own home was the most important there s really no rush we have our home back and that s the main thing days from just pp fully inclusive

comes to your office offer him cup of coffee and when you re doing your holiday shopping online make sure you re holding large glass of iced tea the physical sensation of warmth encourages emotional warmth while cold drink in hand prevents you from making unwise decisions those are the practical lesson being drawn from recent research by psychologist john bargh psychologists have known that one person s perception of another s warmth is powerful determiner in social relationships judging someone to be either warm or cold is primary consideration even trumping evidence that cold person may be more capable much of this is rooted in very early childhood experiences bargh argues when babies conceptual sense of the world around them is shaped by physical sensations particularly warmth and coldness classic studics by harry harlow published in showed monkeys preferred to stay close to cloth mother rather than one made of wire even when the wire mother carried food bottle harlow s work and later studies have led psychologists to stress the need for warm physical contact from caregivers to help young children grow into healthy adults with normal social skills feelings of warmth and coldness in social judgments appear to be universal although no worldwide study has been done bargh says that describing people as warm or cold is common to many cultures and studies have found those perceptions influence judgment in dozens of countries to test the relationship between physical and psychological warmth bargh conducted an experiment which involved college students research assistant who was unaware of the study s hypotheses handed the students either hot cup of coffee or cold drink to hold while the researcher filled out short information form the drink was then handed back after that the students were asked to rate the personality of person based on particular description those who had briefly held the warm drink regarded person as warmer than those who had held the iced drink we are grounded in our physical experiences even when we think abstractly says bargh according to paragraph person s emotion may be affected by the visitors to his office the psychology lessons he has his physical feeling of coldness the things he has bought online the author mentions harlow s experiment to show that adults should develop social skills babies need warm physical contact caregivers should be healthy adults monkeys have social relationships in bargh s experiment the students were asked to evaluate someone s personality write down their hypotheses fill out personal information form hold coffee and cold drink alternatively after that the students were asked to rate the personality of person based on particular description we can infer from the passage that abstract thinking does not come from physical experiences feelings of warmth and coldness are studied worldwide physical temperature affects how we see others capable persons are often cold to others what would be the best title for the passage drinking for better social relationships experiments of personality evaluation developing better drinking habits physical sensations and emotions in ancient egypt the pharaoh treated the poor message runner like prince when he arrived at the palace if he brought good news however if the exhausted runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news his head was cut off shades of that spirit spread over today s conversations once friend and i packed up some peanut butter and sandwiches for an outing as we walked lightheartedly out the door picnic basket in hand smiling neighbor looked up at the sky and said oh boy bad day for picnic the weatherman says it s going to rain i wanted to strike him on the face with the peanut butter and sandwiches not for his stupid weather report for his smile several months ago i was racing to catch bus as i breathlessly put my handful of cash across the greyhound counter the sales agent said with broad smile oh that bus left five minutes ago dreams of headcutting it s not the news that makes someone angry it s the unsympathetic attitude with which it s delivered everyone must give bad news from time to time and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude doctor advising patient that she needs an operation does it in caring way boss informing an employee he didn t get the job takes on sympathetic tone big winners know when delivering any bad news they should share the feeling of the receiver unfortunately many people are not aware of this when you are tired from long flight has hotel clerk cheerfully said that your room isn t ready yet when you had your heart set on the toast beef has your waiter merrily told you that he just served the last piece it makes you as traveler or diner want to land your fist right on their unsympathetic faces had my neighbor told me of the upcoming rainstorm with sympathy i would have appreciated his warning had the greyhound salesclerk sympathetically informed me that my bus had already left i probably would have said oh that s all right i ll catch the next one big winners when they bear bad news deliver bombs with the emotion the bombarded person is sure to have in paragraph the writer tells the story of the pharaoh to make comparison introduce topic describe scene offer an argument in the writer s opinion his neighbor was friendly warmhearted not considerate not helpful from dreams of headcutting paragraph we learn that the writer was mad at the sales agent was reminded of the cruel pharaoh wished that the sales agent would have bad dreams dreamed of cutting the sales agent s head that night what is the main idea of the text delivering bad news properly is important in communication helping others sincerely is the key to business success receiving bad news requires great courage learning ancient traditions can be useful rainforest is an area covered by tall trees with the total high rainfall spreading quite equally through the year and the temperature rarely dipping below rainforests have great effect on the world environment because they can take in heat from the sun and adjust the climate without the forest cover these areas would reflect more heat into the atmosphere warming the rest of the world losing the rainforests may also influence wind and rainfall patterns potentially causing certain natural disasters all over the world in the past hundred years humans have begun destroying rainforests in search of three major resources land for crops wood for paper and other products land for raising farm animals this action affects the environment as whole for example lot of carbon dioxide in the air comes from burning the rainforests people obviously have need for the resources we gain from cutting trees but we will suffer much more than we will benefit there are two main reasons for this firstly when people cut down trees generally they can only use the land for year or two secondly cutting large sections of rainforests may provide good supply of wood right now but in the long run it actually reduces the world s wood supply rainforests are often called the world s drug store more than of the medicines we use today come from plants in rainforests however fewer than of rainforest plants have been examined for their medical value it is extremely likely that our best chance to cure diseases lies somewhere in the world s shrinking rainforests rainforests can help to adjust the climate because they reflect more heat into the atmosphere bring about high rainfall throughout the world rarely cause the temperature to drop lower than reduce the effect of heat from the sun on the earth what does the word this underlined in the third paragraph refer to we will lose much more than we can gain humans have begun destroying rainforests people have strong desire for resources much carbon dioxide comes from burning rainforests it can be inferred from the text that we can get enough resources without rainforests there is great medicine potential in rainforests we will grow fewer kinds of crops in the gained land the level of annual rainfall affects wind patterns what might be the best title for the text how to save rainforests how to protect nature rainforests and the environment rainforests and medical development what is ebay the simple answer is that it is global trading platform where nearly anyone can trade practically anything people can sell and buy all kinds of products and goods including cars movies and dvds sporting goods travel tickets musical instruments clothes and shoes the list goes on and on the idea came from pierre omidyar who was born in paris and moved to washington when he was still child at high school he became very interested in computer programming and after graduating from tufts university in he worked for the next few years as computer engineer in his free time he started ebay as kind of hobby at first offering the service free by word of mouth by there was so much traffic on the website that he had to upgrade and he began charging fee to members joined by friend peter skoll and in by his capable ceo meg whitman he has never looked back even in the great com crashes of the late s ebay has gone from strength to strength it is now one of the ten most visited online shopping websites on the internet ebay sells connections not goods putting buyer and seller into contact with each other all you have to do is take an ephoto write description fill out sales form and you are in business the world is your market place of course for each item sold ebay gets percentage and that is great deal of money every day there are more than sixteen million items listed on ebay and eighty percent of the items are sold ebay we learn from the text that ebay provides people with way of buying and selling goods website for them to upgrade place to exhibit their own photos chance to buy things at low prices why did pierre create ebay after graduating from university for fun to make money for gathering the engineers to fulfill task of his company from he has never looked back in paragraph we learn that pierre did not feel lonely was always hopeful did not think about the past became more and more successful peter how does ebay make money from its website by bringing sellers together by charging for each sale by listing items online by making ephotos i was waiting for phone call from my agent he had left message the night before telling me that my show was to be cancelled i called him several times but each time his secretary told me that he was in meeting and that he would call me later so i waited and waited but there was still no call three hours passing by i became more and more impatient i was certain that my agent didn t care about my work and he didn t care about me i was overcome with that thought i started to shout at the phone let me wait will you who do you think you are at that time i didn t realize my wife was looking on without showing her surprise she rushed in seized the phone tore off the wires and shouted at the phone yeah who do you think you are bad telephone bad telephone and she swept it into the wastebasket i stood watching her speechless what on earth she stepped to the doorway and shouted at the rest of the house now hear this all objects in this room if you do anything to upset my husband out you go then she turned to me kissed me and said calmly honey you just have to learn how to take control with that she left the room after watching crazy woman rushing in and out shouting at everything in sight i noticed that something in my mood had changed i was laughing how could i have trouble with that phone her antics helped me realize i had been driven crazy by small things twenty minutes later my agent did call i was able to listen to him and talk to him calmly why did the author shout at the telephone he was mad at the telephone he was angry with his agent he was anxious about his wife he was impatient with the secretary what did the author s wife do after she heard his shouting she said nothing she shouted at him she called the agent she threw the phone away what made the author laugh his own behavior his wife s suggestion his changeable feelings his wife s sweet kiss how could i have trouble with that telephone realized i had been driven crazy by small things what does the underlined word antics refer to smart words unusual actions surprising looks anxious feelings after watching crazy woman rushing in and out shouting at everything in sight i noticed that something in my mood had changed after watching in sight that how to be winner sir steven redgrave winner of olympic gold medals in i was found to have developed

people diet to look more attractive fish diet to avoid being beaten up thrown out of their social group and getting eaten as result that is the fascinating conclusion of the latest research into fish behavior by team of australian scientists the research team have discovered that subordinate fish voluntarily diet to avoid challenging their larger competitors in studying gobies we noticed that only the largest two individuals male and female had breeding rights within the group explains marian wong all other group members are nonbreeding females each being smaller than its next largest competitor we wanted to find out how they maintain this precise size separation the reason for the size difference was easy to see once subordinate fish grows to within of the size of its larger competitor it causes fight which usually ends in the smaller goby being driven away from the group more often than not the evicted fish is then eaten up it appeared that the smaller fish were keeping themselves small in order to avoid challenging the boss fish whether they did so voluntarily by restraining how much they ate was not clear the research team decided to do an experiment they tried to fatten up some of the subordinate gobies to see what happened to their surprise the gobies simply refused the extra food they were offered clearly preferring to remain small and avoid fights over having feast the discovery challenges the traditional scientific view of how boss individuals keep their position in group previously it was thought that large individuals simply used their weight and size to threaten their subordinates and take more of the food for themselves so keeping their competitors small while the habits of gobies may seem little mysterious dr wong explains that understanding the relationships between boss and subordinate animals is important to understanding how hierarchical societies remain stable the research has proved the fact that voluntary dieting is habit far from exclusive to humans as yet we lack complete understanding of how widespread the voluntary reduction of food intake is in nature the researchers comment data on human dieting suggests that while humans generally diet to improve health or increase attractiveness rarely does it improve longterm health and males regularly prefer females that are fatter than the females own ideal when goby grows to within of the size of its larger competitor it faces danger has breeding rights eats its competitor leaves the group itself the underlined words the evicted fish in paragraph refer to the fish beaten up the fish found out the fish fattened up the fish driven away the experiment showed that the smaller fish fought over feast went on diet willingly preferred some extra food challenged the boss fish what is the text mainly about fish dieting and human dieting dieting and health human dieting fish dieting find which direction is south do you have good sense of direction if not please take with you compass but if you forget to take compass you can still find your way it s never good idea to imagine that the family member who was entrusted with the job of mapreading actually knows where the family is you can tell by the slightly confused look on their faces that nothing on the ground seems to match the map never mind the sun is shining and it s still morning if you don t know the exact time you can still find out where south is but you ll need to be patient find straight stick and put it in the ground in place where you can mark its shadow try to position the stick as vertically as you can you can check this by making simple plumb line with piece of string and weight you haven t got any string ok use thread from your clothes with button tied at the end to act as weight mark the end of the shadow cast by the stick wait approximately half an hour and mark the end of the shadow again keep doing this until you have made several marks the mark nearest the stick will represent the shortest shadow which is cast at midday when the sun is highest in the sky and pointing to the exact south pick point in the distance along the line between the shortest shadow and the stick that point is south of where you are now you can turn the map like you did before and find which way you should be travelling to find the direction we ought to be patient probably because it is not easy to find proper stick it is not easy to position the stick it takes hours to make the marks it takes about half an hour to make the marks the passage would probably be most helpful to those who draw maps those who get lost those who make compasses those who do experiments which of the following pictures best shows the way of finding the direction of south the author presents this passage by telling an interesting story describing an activity in lively way testing an idea by reasoning introducing practical method plants can t communicate by moving or making sounds as most animals do instead plants produce volatile compounds chemicals that easily change from liquid to gas flower s sweet smell for example comes from volatile compounds that the plant produces to attract insects such as bugs and bees plants can also detect volatile compounds produced by other plants tree under attack by hungry insects for instance may give off volatile compounds that let other trees know about the attack in response the other trees may send off chemicals to keep the bugs away or even chemicals that attract the bugs natural enemies now scientists have created quick way to understand what plants are saying chemical sensor called an electronic nose the enose can tell compounds that crop plants make when they re attacked scientists say the enose could help quickly detect whether plants are being eaten by insects but today the only way to detect such insects is to visually inspect individual plants this is challenging task for managers of greenhouses enclosed gardens that can house thousands of plants the research team worked with an enose that recognizes volatile compounds inside the device sensors chemically react with volatile compounds based on these interactions the enose gives off electronic signals that the scientists analyze using computer software to test the nose the team presented it with healthy leaves from cucumber pepper and tomato plants all common greenhouse crops then the scientists collected samples of air around damaged leaves from each type of crop these plants had been damaged by insects or by scientists who made holes in the leaves with hole punch the enose it turns out could identify healthy cucumber pepper and tomato plants based on the volatile compounds they produce it could also identify tomato leaves that had been damaged but even more impressive the device could tell which type of damage by insects or with hole punch had been done to the tomato leaves with some finetuning device like the enose could one day be used in greenhouses to quickly spot harmful bugs the researchers say device like this could also be used to identify fruits that are perfectly ripe and ready to pick and eat says natalia dudareva biochemist at purdue university in west lafayette ind who studies smells of flowers and plants hopefully scientists believe the device could bring large benefits to greenhouse managers in the near future enose we learn from the text that plants communicate with each other by making some sounds waving their leaves producing some chemicals sending out electronic signals instead plants produce volatile compounds chemicals that what did the scientists do to find out if the enose worked they presented it with all common crops they fixed sensors inside the device they collected different damaged leaves they made tests on damaged and healthy leaves enose according to the writer the most amazing thing about the enose is that it can pick out ripe fruits spot the insects quickly distinguish different damages to the leaves recognize unhealthy tomato leaves but even more impressive the device could tell which type of damage enose we can infer from the last paragraph that the enose is unable to tell the smell of flowers is not yet used in greenhouses is designed by scientists at purdue is helpful in killing harmful insects could one day be used in greenhouses to enose greenhouses the year is the year of ox the ox is representative of the farming culture of china in the farming economy oxen are the major animals pulling plows of course the good of oxen is not limited to plowing in fact they are seen as boats on land for their ability to carry loads besides the whole body of an ox is full of treasures their meat and milk are food full of nutrition and their skin can be used to make clothes and shoes with all these qualities oxen are regarded as generous creatures in the past oxen played an important role in the spiritual life of the chinese even today oxen still play special part in some folk activities for example some people who live in southwest china will cook cattle bone soup and share it among family members when holding the ceremony for children who reach they believe that the cattle bone soup represents the blood relationship among family members in order to express their love for oxen people in some other areas will run to shake off diseases on the th day of the first month by the lunar calendar and during their run they will take their oxen along which indicates they regard the creature as human because of the contribution of oxen in their lives the chinese people are very grateful to the animal in addition the use of oxen in ceremonies and the thanks people owe to oxen help to develop various traditional customs which becomes an important part of the folk culture of the chinese nation the words boats on land underlined in paragraph refer to animals for taking goods creatures for pulling plows treasures of the folk culture tools in the farming economy they are seen as ability to carry loads for from the third paragraph we know that oxen are no more important today than in the past ceremonies are held when people cook cattle bone soup oxen are treated as human in some areas of china people run with oxen to shake off diseases every month which of the following helps to develop traditional customs the special role of oxen in farming people s respect and love for oxen the practical value of an ox s body the contribution of oxen to the economy why does the author write the text to stress the importance of oxen in farming to introduce the chinese folk culture to describe how to celebrate the year of ox to explain how to develop agriculture with oxen have you ever noticed the colour of the water in river or stream after heavy rainfall what do you think caused this change in colour it is soil that has been washed into the river from the riverbank or from the nearby fields components of soil soil is made up of number of layers each having its own distinctive colour and texture the upper layer is known as the litter it acts like blanket limiting temperature changes and reducing water loss the topsoil layer is made up of small particles of rock mixed with rotten plant and animal matter called humus which is black and gives the topsoil its dark colour this layer is usually rich in nutrients oxygen and water below the topsoil is the subsoil layer that contains more stones mixed with only small amounts of organic matter this layer is lighter in colour because of the lack of humus beneath the soil lies layer of bedrock soil forms from the bottom up over time bedrock is attacked by rain wind frost and snow it is gradually broken down into smaller particles in process called weathering plants begin to grow and rotten materials enrich the topsoil most of the soil in eastern canada for example was formed from weathered rock that was exposed when the ice disappeared years ago water beneath the soil surface water collects and flows above the ground in lakes ponds and rivers once in the soil or rock it is called groundwater gravity pulls groundwater through the soil in process called percolation eventually the water reaches layer called the water table under this is bedrock through which water cannot percolate as water percolates downward it dissolves organic matter and minerals from the soil and carries them to deeper layers this causes serious problem because plants require these nutrients for growth soil ph soil can be acidic neutral or basic the ph of the soil is determined by the nature of the rock from which it was formed and by the nature of the plants that grow and rot in it the acidity of rain and snow can lower the ph of the groundwater that enters the soil by burning fossil fuels such as coal oil and gasoline humans have been contributing to higher levels of acidity in many soils when fossil fuels are burned gases are released into the air and then fall back to earth as acid rain acid soil increases the problem of carrying nutrients to lower soil levels as nutrients are removed soil is less fertile plants grow more slowly in acidic soil and also become easily attacked by diseases ph the layer of soil that provides necessary nutrients for plant growth is called litter topsoil humus subsoil the topsoil layer is made up of small particles of rock mixed with rotten plant which is black and gives the topsoil its dark colour this layer is usually rich in nutrients topsoil layer according to the text which of the following is not true soil forms from weathered rock on the earth surface the deeper layer of soil is darker in colour than the surface soil air pollution is partially responsible for acid soil groundwater tends to carry away nutrients for plant growth below the topsoil is the subsoil layer that contains more stones mixed with only small amounts of organic matter this layer is lighter in colour because of the lack of humus we can infer from the passage that the water table lies between the topsoil layer and the subsoil layer in the subsoil layer above bedrock between the subsoil layer and bedrock in the bedrock layer beneath the subsoil eventually the water reaches layer called the water table under this is bedrock through which water cannot percolate water table bedrock the underlined word dissolve is used to express the idea that organic matter and minerals from soil are rushed away into the river cleaned and purified by water destroyed and carried away by water mixed with water and become part of it and carries them to deeper layers the latest research suggests that the key factor separating geniuses from the merely accomplished is not iq generally bad predictor of success instead it s purposeful practice top performers spend more hours practising their craft if you wanted to picture how typical genius might develop you take girl who possessed slightly above average language ability it wouldn t have to be big talent just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction then you would want her to meet say novelist who coincidentally shared some similar qualities maybe the writer was from the same town had the same family background or shared the same birthday this contact would give the girl vision of her future self it would give her some idea of fascinating circle she might someday join it would also help if one of her parents died when she was giving her strong sense of insecurity and fuelling desperate need for success armed with this ambition she would read novels and life stories of writers without end this would give her primary knowledge of her field she be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings then she would practise writing her practice would be slow painstaking and errorfocused by practising in this way she delays the automatizing process her mind wants to turn conscious newly learned skills into unconscious automatically performed skills by practising slowly by breaking skills down into tiny parts and repeating she forces the brain to internalize better pattern of performance then she would find an adviser who would provide constant stream of feedback viewing her performance from the outside correcting the smallest errors pushing her to take on tougher challenges by now she is redoing problems how do i get characters into room dozens and dozens of times she is establishing habits of thought she can call upon in order to understand or solve future problems the primary quality our young writer possesses is not some mysterious genius it s the ability to develop purposeful laborious and boring practice routine the latest research takes some of the magic out of great achievement but it underlines fact that is often neglected public discussion is affected by genetics and what we re hardwired to do and it s true that genes play role in our capabilities but the brain is also very plastic we construct ourselves through behavior iq the passage mainly deals with the function of iq in cultivating writer the relationship between genius and success the decisive factor in making genius the way of gaining some sense of distinction iq by reading novels and writers stories the girl could come to understand the inner structure of writing join fascinating circle of writers someday share with novelist her likes and dislikes learn from the living examples to establish sense of security this would give her primary knowledge of her field she be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings in the girl s long painstaking training process her adviser forms primary challenging force to her success her writing turns into an automatic pattern of performance she acquires the magic of some great achievements she comes to realize she is hardwired to write by practising in this way she delays the automatizing process her mind wants to turn conscious newly learned skills into unconscious automatically perfomed skills what can be concluded from the passage fuelling ambition plays leading role in one s success responsible adviser is more important than the knowledge of writing as to the growth of genius iq doesn t matter but just his her efforts what really matters is what you do rather than who you are iq west palmdale boulevard

was the first snow of winter an exciting day for every child but not for most teachers up until now i had been able to dress myself for recess but today i would need some help miss finlayson my kindergarten teacher at princess elizabeth school near hamilton ontario had been through first snow days many times in her long career but l think she may still remember this one i managed to get into my wool snow pants but i struggled with my jacket because it didn t fit well it was handmedown from my brother and it made me wonder why i had to wear his ugly clothes at least my hat and matching scarf were mine and they were quite pretty finally it was time to have miss finlayson help me with my boots in her calm motherly voice she said by the end of winter you will be able to put on your own boots i didn t realize at the time that this was more statement of hope than of confidence i handed her my boots and stuck out my feet like most children i expected the adult to do all the work after much wiggling and pushing she managed to get the first one into place and then with sigh worked the second one on too i announced they re on the wrong feet with the grace that only experience can bring she struggled to get the boots off and went through the joyless task of putting them on again then i said these aren t my boots you know as she pulled the offending boots from my feet she still managed to look both helpful and interested once they were off i said they are my brother s boots my mother makes me wear them and i hate them somehow from long years of practice she managed to act as though i wasn t an annoying little girl she pushed and shoved less gently this time and the boots were returned to their proper place on my feet with great sigh of relief seeing the end of her struggle with me she asked now where are your gloves i looked into her eyes and said i didn t want to lose them so i put them into the toes of my boots according to the passage the little girl got from her brother the wool snow pants and the jacket the jacket and the boots the jacket and the hat the boots and the gloves my jacket because it didn t fit well it was handmedown from my brother these aren t my boots they are my brother s boots my mother makes me wear them what made it so hard for the teacher to help the little girl put her boots on the gloves in the toes of the boots the slowness of the teacher the wrong size of the boots the unwillingness of the girl i didn t want to lose them so i put them into the toes of my boots it can be inferred that before the little girl finally went out to enjoy the first snow of winter the teacher had to help her put on her boots once twice three times four times the aren t my boots which of the following sentences from the text best indicates that the teacher is very considerate in her calm motherly voice she said by the end of winter paragraph with the grace that only experience can bring she struggled to paragraph she still managed to look both helpful and interested paragraph she managed to act as though i wasn t an annoying little girl paragraph an increase in students applying to study economics at university is being attributed to the global economic crisis awakening public thirst for knowledge about how the financial system works applications for degree courses beginning this autumn were up by this january according to ucas the universities and colleges admissions service spokesman for the royal economic society said applications to do economics at alevel were also up professor john beath the president of the society and leading lecturer at st andrews university said his firstyear lectures which are open to students from all departments were drawing crowds of rather than the usual there are large number of students who are not economics majors who would like to learn something about it one of the things i have done this year is to relate my teaching to contemporary events in way that one hash t traditionally done he added university applications rose last year but there were rises above average in several subjects nursing saw jump with people s renewed interest in careers in the public sector which are seen as more secure in economic crisis recent study showed almost two thirds of parents believed schools should do more to teach pupils about financial matters and almost half said their children had asked them what was going on although minority of parents felt they did not understand it themselves well enough to explain zack hocking the head of child trust funds said it s possible that one good thing to arise from the downturn will be generation that s financially wiser and better equipped to manage their money through times of economic uncertainty professor john beath s lectures are given in traditional way connected with the present situation open to both students and their parents warmly received by economists careers in the public sector are more attractive because of their greater stability higher pay fewer applications better reputation in the opinion of most parents economics should be the focus of school teaching more students should be admitted to universities the teaching of financial matters should be strengthened children should solve financial problems themselves according to hocking the global economic crisis might make the youngsters wiser in money management have access to better equipment confident about their future careers get jobs in child trust funds hocking what s the main idea of the text universities have received more applications economics is attracting an increasing number of students college students benefit lot from economic uncertainty parents are concerned with children s subject selecttion volcanic eruption in iceland has sent ash across northern europe airlines have stopped or changed the flights across the atlantic ocean leaving hundreds of passengers stuck in airports grimsvotn is one of the largest and most active volcanoes in europe what makes grimsvotn different is that it lies under huge glacier of ice up to meters thick the hot volcano heats up the ice above it which then forms layer of water between the glacier and the volcano this layer of water puts pressure on the volcano keeping it stable as the water flows ont from under the glacier the pressure lifts the lava from the volcano then comes up to the surface this is exactly what happened today now airlines have to make changes to their flights so as not to fly through the clouds of volcanic ash according to klm one of europe s biggest airlines airplanes cannot go under the cloud or over it going through the cloud can result in ash getting stuck in the airplane s engines causing damage to the plane the eruption has also caused problems for animals in iceland the volcano left ash and sharp glasslike rocks all over the countryside farmers are keeping their animals inside to stop them from eating ashcovered grass or the sharp objects crimsvotn what makes grimsvotn different from other volcanoes it is below ice it lies under the sea it is the largest volcano its lava affects the airlines what keeps grimsvotn still the slow flow of water the low water temperature the thick glacier the water pressure which of the following is the result of the volcanic eruption people stop traveling in europe airlines suffer from the loss of planes it becomes dangerous for animals to eat outside farmers have lost many of their animals this text is most probably taken from research paper newspaper report class presentation geography textbook tens of thousands of theatre tickets will be given away to young people next year as part of government campaign to inspire lifelong love for theatre the plan to offer free seats to people aged between to funded with million of taxpayers money was announced yesterday by andy burnham the culture secretary it received cautious welcome from some in the arts world who expressed concern that the tickets may not reach the most underprivileged the plan comes as west end theatres are enjoying record audiences thanks largely to musicals teaming up with television talent shows attendances reached million in up percent on itself record year total sales were up percent on to almost million one theatre source criticised the government s priorities in funding free tickets when pensioners were struggling to buy food and fuel saying i don t know why the government s wasting money on this the young vic as the times reported today offers excellent performances at cheap prices there was praise for the government s plan from dominic cooke of the royal court theatre who said i support any move to get young people into theatre and especially one that aims to do it all over england not just in london ninetyfive publicly funded theatres could apply for funding under the twoyear plan in return they will offer free tickets on at least one day each week to to yearolds firstcome firstserved it is likely to be on mondays traditionally quiet night for the theatre mr burnham said young person attending the theatre can find it an exciting experience and be inspired to explore new world but sometimes people miss out on it because they fear it s not for them it s time to change this perception jeremy hunt the shadow culture secretary said the real issue is not getting enthusiastic children into the theatre but improving arts education so that more young people want to go in the first place for too many children theatres are nogo area critics of the plan argued that the theatres would be overcrowded it would be waste of money pensioners wouldn t get free tickets the government wouldn t be able to afford it criticised i don t know why the government s wasting money on this according to the supporters the plan should benefit the television industry focus on producing better plays help increase the sales of tickets involve all the young people in england which of the following is true about the plan ninetyfive theatres have received funding everyone will get at least one free ticket it may not benefit all the young people free tickets are offered once every day everyone we can infer from the passage that in england many plays are not for young people many young people don t like theatre people know little about the plan children used to receive good arts education according to the passage the issue to offer free tickets to young people seems controversial inspiring exciting unreasonable controversial foreign drivers will have to pay onthespot fines of up to for breaking the traffic law to be carried out next month if they do not have enough cash or working credit crad their vehicles will be clamped until they pay and they will face an additional fee of for getting back their vehicles the law will also apply to british citizens the fines will be described officially as deposits when the traffic law takes effect because the money would be returned if the driver went to court and was found not guilty in practice very few foreign drivers are likely to return to britain to deal with their cases foreign drivers are rarely charged because police cannot take action against them if they fail to appear in court instead officers often merely give warnings three million foreiguregistered vehicles enter britain each

paragraph serves as n explanation introduction comment background the foreign drivers who break the traffic law and do not pay on the spot are likely to be fined up to we can learn from the passage that many foreign drivers have been fined by british police german vehicles enter britain every year percent of foreign vehicles entering britain have failed safety tests british drivers will be punished with points and fines for breaking the traffic law the new traffic law is mainly intended to limit the number of foreign vehicles entering britain increase the british government s additional

true according to the passage dogsledding is the most popular sport among local people watching wildlife is memorable experience travellers should bring their own sports equipment shopping is too simple pleasure to enjoy wildlife watching also creates satisfying memories banff sport shops rent equipment the purpose of the writing is to promote scenic spots in canada advertise for the sports in banff introduce tourist activities in banff describe breathtaking views in banff banff resort guide editors banff in canada views sometimes the simplest ideas are the best for example to absorb heat from the sun to heat water you need large flat black surfaces one way to do that is to build those surfaces specially on the roofs of buildings but why go to all that trouble when cities are full of black surfaces already in the form of asphalt roads ten years ago this thought came into the mind of arian de bondt dutch engineer he finally persuaded his boss to follow it up the result is that their building is now heated in winter and cooled in summer by system that relies on the surface of the road outside the heatcollector is system of connected water pipes most of them run from one side of the street to the other just under the asphalt road some however dive deep into the ground when the street surface gets hot in summer water pumped through the pipes picks up this heat and takes it underground through one of the diving pipes at depth of metres lies natural aquifer into which several heat exchangers have been built the hot water from the street runs through these exchangers warming the groundwater before returning to the surface through another pipe the aquifer is thus used as heat store in winter the working system is changed slightly water is pumped through the heat exchangers to pick up the heat stored during summer this water goes into the building and is used to warm the place up after performing that task it is pumped under the asphalt and its remaining heat keeps the road free of snow and ice which of the following is true according to the first two paragraphs arian de bondt got his idea from his boss large flat black surfaces need to be built in cities the dutch engineer s system has been widely used heat can also be collected from asphalt roads for what purpose are the diving pipes used to absorb heat from the sun to store heat for future use to turn solar energy into heat energy to carry heat down below the surface from the last paragraph we can learn that some pipes have to be rearranged in winter the system can do more than warming up the building the exchangers will pick up heat from the street surface less heat may be collected in winter than in summer what is most likely to be discussed in the paragraph that follows what we shall do if the system goes wrong what we shall do if there are no asphalt roads how the system cools the building in summer how the system collects heat in spring and autumn it s not easy being teenager nor is it easy being the parent of teenager you can make your child feel angry hurt or misunderstood by what you say without realizing it yourself it is important to give your child the space he needs to grow while gently letting him know that you ll still be there for him when he needs you expect lot from your child just not everything except for health and safety problems such as drug use or careless driving consider everything else open to discussion if your child is unwilling to discuss something don t insist he tell you what s on his mind the more you insist the more likely that he ll clam up instead let him attempt to solve things by himself at the same time remind him that you re always there for him should he seek advice or help show respect for your teenager s privacy never read his mail or listen in on personal conversations teach your teenager that the family phone is for the whole family if your child talks on the family s telephone for too long tell him he can talk for minutes but then he must stay off the phone for at least an equal period of time this not only frees up the line so that other family members can make and receive calls but teaches your teenager moderation or if you are open to the idea allow your teenager his own phone that he pays for with his own pocket money or parttime job the main purpose of the text is to tell parents how to get along with teenager how to respect teenager how to understand teenager how to help teenager grow up what does the phrase clam up in paragraph probably mean become excited show respect refuse to talk seek help clam up refuse to talk what should parents do in raising teenager according to the text not allow him to learn driving or take drugs give him advice only when necessary let him have his own telephone not talk about personal things with him at the same time remind him that you re always there for him should he seek advice or help few years ago paul gerner began to gather group of architects in las vegas to ask them what it would take to design public school that used percent less energy cost much less to build and obviously improved student learning i think half of them fell off their chairs gerner says gerner manages school facilities for clark county nevada district roughly the size of massachusetts by additional students will enter the already crowded publiceducation system gerner needs new schools to house them four architecture teams have nearly finished designing primary school prototypes they plan to construct their schools starting in the district will then assess how well the schools perform and three winners will copy those designs in to new buildings green schools are appearing all over but in clark county which stands out for its vastness such aggressive targets are difficult because design requirements like more natural light for students go against the realities of desert climate one of the biggest challenges is getting the right site orientation mark mcginty director at sh architecture says his firm recently completed high school in las vegas you have the same building same set of windows but if its orientation is incorrect and it faces the sun it will be really expensive to cool surprisingly the man responsible for one of the most progressive greendesign competitions has doubts about ideas of ecofriendly buildings i don t believe in the new green religion gerner says some of the building technologies that you get are impractical i m interested in those that work but he wouldn t mind if some green features inspire students he says he hopes to set up green energy systems that allow them to learn about the process of harvesting wind and solar power you never know what s going to start the interest of child to study math and science he says gerner how did the architects react to gerner s design requirements they lost balance in excitement they showed strong disbelief they expressed little interest they burst into cheers i think half of them fell of their chairs which order of steps is followed in carrying out the project assessment prototype design construction assessment design prototype construction design assessment prototype construction design prototype assessment construction what makes it difficult to build green schools in clark county the large size limited facilities the desert climate poor natural resources such aggressive targets are difficult because design requirements like more natural light for students go against the realities off desert climate what does gerner think of the ideas of green schools they are questionable they are out of date they are advanced they are practical surprisingly the man responsible for one of the most progressive greendesign competitions has doubts about ideas of ecofriendly buildings i don t believe in the new green religion gerner says gerner guatemala city reuters fish that lives in mangrove swamps across the americas can live out of water for months at time similar to how animals adapted to land millions of years ago new study shows the mangrove rivulus type of small killifish lives in small pools of water in certain type of empty nut or even old beer cans in the mangrove swamps of belize the united states and brazil when their living place dries up they live on the land in logs said scott taylor researcher at the brevard endangered lands program in florida the fish whose scientific name is rivulus marmoratus can grow as large as three inches they group together in logs and breathe air through their skin until they can find water again the new scientific discovery came after trip to belize we kicked over log and the fish just came crowding out taylor told reuters in neighboring guatemala by telephone he said he will make his study on the fish known to the public in an american magazine early next year in lab tests taylor said he found the fish can live up to days out of water without eating some other fish can live out of water for short period of time the walking catfish found in southeast asia can stay on land for hours at time while lungfish found in australia africa and south america can live ont of water but only in an inactive state but no other known fish can be out of water as long as the mangrove rivulus and remain active according to patricia wright biologist at canada s university of guelph further studies of the fish may tell how animals changed over time these animals live in conditions similar to those that existed millions of years ago when animals began making the transition from water onto land wright said the mangrove rivulus is type of fish that likes eating nuts prefers living in dry places is the longest living fish on earth cau stay alive for two months out of water taylor who will write up report on mangrove rivulus patricia wright researchers in guatemala scientists from belize scott taylor scott taylor according to the text lungfish can breathe through its skin move freely on dry land remain alive out of water be as active on land as in water lungfish what can we say about the discovery of mangrove rivulus it was made quite by accident it was based on lab test of sea life it was supported by an american magazine it was helped by patricia wright taylor old wives tales are beliefs passed down from one generation to another for example most of us remember our parents telling us to eat more of certain foods or not to do certain things is there any truth in these teachings some of them agree with present medical thinking but others have not passed the test of time did your mother ever tell you to eat your carrots because they are good for your eyes scientists now report that eating carrots can help prevent serious eye disease called macular degeneration eating just one carrot day can reduce the possibility of getting this disease by garlic is good for you too it can kill the type of virus that causes colds unfortunately not all of mom s advice passed the test of medical studies for example generations of children have been told not to go swimming within an hour after eating but research suggests that there is no danger in doing so do sweets cause tooth problems well yes and no sticky sweets made with grains tend to cause more problems than sweets made with simple sugars even though science can tell us that some of our traditional beliefs don t hold water there is still lot of truth in the old wives tales after all much of this knowledge has been accumulated from thousands of years of experience in family health care we should respect this body of knowledge even as we search for clear scientific support to prove it true or false which of the following is true according to the text eating garlic is good for our eyes sticky sweets are damaging to our teeth swimming after meal is dangerous carrots prevent people from catching colds sticky sweels made with grains tend to cause more problems than sweets made with simple sugars sticky sweets the author develops the third paragraph mainly by cause and effect by order in space by order in time by examples the phrase hold water in the last paragraph most probably means to be believable to be valuable to be admirable to be suitable hold water what is the author s attitude toward old wives tales in the text subjective objective dissatisfied curious even at school there had been an unhealthy competition between george and richard i ll be the first millionaire in coleford richard used to boast and you ll be sorry you knew me george would reply because i ll be the best lawyer in town george never did become lawyer and richard never made any money instead both men opened bookshops on opposite sides of coleford high street it was hard to make money from books which made the competition between them worse then richard married mysterious girl the couple spent their honeymoon on the coast but richard never came back the police found his wallet on deserted beach but the body was never found he must have drowned now with only one bookshop in town business was better for george but sometimes he sat in his narrow old kitchen and gazed out of the dirty window thinking about his former rival perhaps he missed him george was very interested in old dictionaries he recently found collector in australia who was selling rare first edition when the parcel arrived the book was in perfect condition and george was delighted but while he was having lunch george glanced at the photo in the newspaper that the book had been wrapped in he was astonished the smiling face was older than he remembered but unmistakable trembling george started reading bookends have bought ten bookstores from their rivals dylans the company owned by multimillionaire richard pike is now the largest bookseller in australia richard george richard george george and richard were at school roommates good friends competitors booksellers even at school there had been an unhealthy competition between george and richard how did george feel about richard after his disappearance he envied richard s marriage he thought of richard from time to time he felt lucky with no rival in town he was guilty of richard s death but sometimes he sat in his narrow old kitchen and gazed out of the dirty window thinking about his former rival george richard george got information about richard from dictionary collector in australia the latter s rivals dylans rare first edition of dictionary the wrapping paper of book george glanced at the photo in the newspaper that the book had been wrapped in george richard what happened to george and richard in the end both george and richard became millionaires both of them realized their original ambitions george established successful business while richard was missing richard became millionaire while george had no great success richard george remembering names is an important social skill here are some ways to master it recite and repeat in conversation when you hear person s name repeat it immediately say it to yourself several times without moving your lips you could also repeat the name in way that does not sound forced or artificial ask the other person to recite and repeat you can let other people help you remember their names after you ve been introduced to someone ask that person to spell the name and pronounce it correctly for you most people will be pleased by the effort you re making to learn their names admit you don t know admitting that you can t remember someone s name can actually make people relaxed most of them will feel sympathy if you say i m working to remember names better yours is right on the tip of my tongue what is it again use associations link each person you meet with one thing you find interesting or unusual for example you could make mental note vicki cheng tall black hair to reinforce your associations write them on small card as soon as possible limit the number of new names you learn at one time when meeting group of people concentrate on remembering just two or three names free yourself from remembering everyone few of the people in mass introductions expect you to remember their names another way is to limit yourself to learning just first names last names can come later go early consider going early to conferences parties and classes sometimes just few people show up on time that s fewer names for you to remember and as more people arrive you can hear them being introduced to others an automatic review for you how will most people feel when you try hard to remember their names they will be moved they will be annoyed they will be delighted they will be discouraged most people will be pleased by the effort you re making to learn their names pleased delighted if you can t remember someone s name you may tell him the truth tell him white lie ask him for pity ask others to help you when you meet group of people it is better to remember all their names couple of names first just their last names as many names as possible when meeting group of people concentrate on remembering just two or three names what does the text mainly tell us tips on an important social skill importance of attending parties how to make use of associations how to recite and repeat names we have met the enemy and he is ours we bought him at pet shop when monkeypox disease usually found in the african rain forest suddenly turns up in children in the american midwest it s hard not to wonder if the disease that comes from foreign animals is homing in on human beings most of the infections we think of as human infections started in other animals says stephen morse director of the center for public health preparedness at columbia university it s not just that we re going to where the animals are we re also bringing them closer to us popular foreign pets have brought whole new disease to this country strange illness killed isaksen s pets and she now thinks that keeping foreign pets is bad idea i don t think it s fair to have them as pets when we have such limited knowledge of them says isaksen laws allowing these animals to be brought in from deep forest areas without stricter control need changing says peter schantz monkeypox may be the wakeup call researchers believe infected animals may infect their owners we know very little about these new diseases new bug may be kind at first but it may develop into something harmful monkeypox doesn t look major infectious disease but it is not impossible to pass the disease from person to person we learn from paragraph that the pet sold at the shop may come from columbia prevent us from being infected enjoy being with children suffer from monkeypox why did isaksen advise people not to have foreign pets they attack human beings we need to study native animals they can t live out of the rain forest we do not know much about them yet strange illness killed isaksen s pets and she now thinks that keeping foreign pets is bad idea i don t think it s fair to have them as pets when we have such limited knowledge of them what does the phrase the wakeup call in paragraph most probably mean new disease clear warning dangerous animal morning call the wakeup call the text suggests that in the future we may have to fight against more new diseases may easily get infected by diseases from dogs should not be allowed to have pets should stop buying pets from africa runners in relay race pass stick in one direction however merchants passed silk gold fruit and glass along the silk road in more than one direction they earned their living by traveling the famous silk road the silk road was not simple trading network it passed through thousands of cities and towns it started from eastern china across central asia and the middle east and ended in the mediterranean sea it was used from about to about when sea travel offered new routes it was sometimes called the world s longest highway however the silk road was made up of many routes not one smooth path they passed through what are now countries the routes crossed mountains and deserts and had many dangers of hot sun deep snow and even battles only experienced traders could return safe the silk road got its name from its most prized product silk could be used like money to pay taxes or buy goods but the traders carried more than just silk gold silver and glass from europe were much found in the middle east and asia horses traded from other areas changed farming practices in china indian merchants traded salt and other valuable goods chinese merchants traded paper which produced an immediate effect on the west apples traveled from central asia to rome the chinese had learned to graft different trees together to make new kinds of fruit they passed this science on to others including the romans the romans used grafting to grow the apple trading along the silk road led to worldwide business years before the world wide web the people along the silk road did not share just goods they also shared their beliefs the silk road provided pathways for learning diplomacy and religion it s probable that traders along the silk road needed to remember the entire trade route to know the making of products to receive certain special training to deal with lot of difficulties the routes crossed mountains and deserts and had many dangers of hot sun deep snow and even battles only experienced traders could return safe the silk road became less important because it was made up of different routes silk trading became less popular sea travel provided easier routes people needed fewer foreign goods it was used from about to about ad when sea travel offered new routes sea travel provided easier routes new technologies could travel along the silk road because people learned from one another shared each other s beliefs traded goods along the route earned their living by traveling the people along the silk road did not share just goods they also shared their beliefs the silk road provided pathways for learning diplomacy and religion what is the best title for the passage the silk road past and present the silk road east meets west the silk road routes full of dangers the silk road pathways for learning the silk road was not simple trading network it passed through thousands of cities and towns it started from eastern china across central asia and the middle east and ended in the mediterranean sea the silk road east meets west four people in england back in stared at photo it wasn t much picture showing black x but three of these people won the nobel prize for figuring out what the photo really showed the shape of dna the discovery brought fame and fortune to scientists james watson francis crick and maurice wilkins the fourth the one who actually made the picture was left out her name was rosalind franklin she should have been up there says historian mary bowden if her photos hadn t been there the others couldn t have come up with the structure one reason franklin was missing was that she had died of cancer four years before the nobel decision but now scholars doubt that franklin was not only robbed of her life by disease but robbed of credit by her competitors at cambridge university in the s watson and crick tried to make models by cutting up shapes of dna s parts and then putting them together in the meantime at king s college in london franklin and wilkins shone xrays at the molecule the rays produced patterns reflecting the shape but wilkins and franklin s relationship was lot rockier than the celebrated teamwork of watson and crick wilkins thought franklin was hired to be his assistant but the college actually employed her to take over the dna project what she did was produce xray pictures that told watson and crick that one of their early models was inside out and she was not shy about saying so that angered watson who attacked her in return mere inspection suggested that she would not easily bend clearly she had to go or be put in her place as franklin s competitors wilkins watson and crick had much to gain by cutting her out of the little group of researchers says historian pnina abiram in at the nobel prize awarding ceremony wilkins thanked colleagues by name before he mentioned franklin watson wrote his book laughing at her crick wrote in that franklin was only two steps away from the solution no franklin was the solution she contributed more than any other player to solving the structure of dna she must be considered codiscoverer abiram says this was backed up by aaron klug who worked with franklin and later won nobel prize himself once described as the dark lady of dna franklin is finally coming into the light dna james watson francis crick maurice wilkins rosalind franklin what is the text mainly about the disagreements among dna researchers the unfair treatment of franklin the process of discovering dna the race between two teams of scientists franklin dna watson was angry with franklin because she took the lead in the competition kept her results from him proved some of his findings wrong shared her data with other scientists franklin watson why is franklin described as dark lady of dna she developed pictures in dark labs she discovered the black x the shape of dna her name was forgotten after her death her contribution was unknown to the public franklin what is the writer s attitude toward wilkins watson and crick disapproving respectful admiring doubtful franklin this was no ordinary class the students who came together were all science or engineering professors at cornell university they had interrupted their research to accept an invitation to take part in an unusual experiment an interesting week of poetry this class was part of study to answer the questions why is science difficult for many nonscience students what can teachers learn about teaching if they take class that is not in their field the students in the poetry class listened to lectures and took notes they had reading tasks and had to write three short papers all students noticed one thing the importance of spoken words in science and engineering classes the instructors put tables and drawings on the blackboard but in this poetry class the instructors just talked they didn t write anything on the board the scientists and engineers noticed one similarity between science and poetry in both subjects students need to find layers of meaning some layers are simple clear and on the surface other layers are deeper and more difficult this search for different levels of meaning doesn t happen much in undergraduate science classes but it is important later in graduate school and it is always important in humanities both the poetry instructors and their students learned something about teaching from this experience one poetry instructor for example now sees the importance of using careful clear definitions when he explains poem he also plans to be more informative as he teaches most of the scientists agreed on several points first humanities classes might help science students to see patterns and decide which information is important second the poetry class was fun one engineer decided we need to change the way we teach engineering to make it an enjoyable experience for students but perhaps the most important result of the experience was this all of the professors began to think about how they teach and how they can teach better what do we know about this unusual class the teachers did lots of writing on the board the teachers were invited to attend several lectures the students were professors from university the students were studying science and humanities this was no ordinary class the students who came together were all science or engineering professors at cornell university the experiment was designed to find out how to teach the students in the science class whether poetry is difficult for science students what to be taught in the humanities class why many humanities students find science hard why is science difficult for many nonscience students finding levels of meaning is important for graduate students in humanities difficult for graduate students in humanities common for undergraduate students in science easy for undergraduate students in science and it is always important in humanities what did the science professors learn after the experiment they should change the way they teach poem could be explained in clear definitions poetry class could be more informative their teaching was an enjoyable experience but perhaps the most important result of the experience was this all of the professors began to think about how they teach and how they can teach better when i was going home to india last year i called up my mother to ask if she wanted anything from china when india had not opened up its markets to the world i carried suitcase loads of dark glasses and jeans thankfully we can get all these anywhere in india now still her answer surprised me green tea as long as i can remember she didn t even drink indian tea i dutifully bought big packet of longjing and headed home to hear the story my mother and her brother both regular newspaper readers believed that chinese green tea was the wonder drug for all illnesses at the turn of the century china was not really familiar to the average indian it was strange country how things change and how soon now every town of any size seems to have china market and everyone is talking about china the government of india has planned to send team to china to see how things are done minister once said that india must open the doors for more foreign investment and such step would work wonders as it did for china but it s twoway street i just heard about thousand shenzhen office workers who have gone to bangalore to train in software meanwhile all the indian it majors are setting up strong presence in china no wonder that trade which was only in the millions just ten years ago was expected to hit about us billion for last year and us billion by goal set by both governments no wonder my colleague wrote some weeks ago about this being the sinoindian century as the two countries started on january the sinoindian friendship year but what is still wonder to me is my mother drinking chinese tea why did the mother ask for chinese green tea she was tired of indian tea she had son working in china she believed it had curing effect she was fond of chinese products what does the author mean by it s twoway street in paragraph china and india have different traffic rules tea trade works wonders in both india and china chinese products are popular in both china and india the exchanges between india and china benefit both what do we know about the indian it industry it will move its head office to shenzhen it is seeking further development in china it has attracted an investment of us billion it caught up with the us it industry in in the text the author expresses his concern for his mother s health his support for drinking chinese green tea his surprise at china s recent development his wonder at the growth of india s it industry people believe that climbing can do good to health where can you learn the skill of climbing then if you think that you have to go to the mountains to learn how to climb you re wrong many americans are learning to climb in city gyms here people are learning on special climbing walls the climbing wall goes straight up and has small holding places for hands and feet how do people climb the wall to climb you need special shoes and harness around your chest to hold you there are ropes tied to your harness the ropes hold you in place so that you don t fall beginner s wall is usually about feet high and you climb straight up there are small pieces of metal that stick out for you to stand on and hold on to sometimes it s easy to see the next piece of metal sometimes it s not the most difficult part is to control your fear it s normal for humans to be afraid of falling so it s difficult not to feel fear but when you move away from the wall the harness and the ropes hold you and you begin to feel safe you move slowly until you reach the top climbing attracts people because it s good exercise for almost everyone you use your whole body especially your arms and legs this sport gives your body complete workout when you climb both your mind and your body can become stronger what can we infer from the passage people are fairly interested in climbing nowadays it is impossible to build up one s body by climbing people can only learn the skill of climbing outdoors it is always easy to see holding places in climbing people believe that climbing can do good to health where can you learn the skill of climbing then climbing attracts people because it s good exercise for almost everyone the most difficult thing to do in wall climbing is to tie ropes to your harness to control your fear to move away from the wall to climb straight up the most difficult part is to control your fear the word workout underlined in the last paragraph most probably means settlement exercise excitement tiredness when you climb both your mind and your body can become stronger why does the author write this passage to tell people where to find gyms to prove the basic need for climbing to encourage people to climb mountains to introduce the sport of wall climbing wall climbing year ago august dave fuss lost his job driving truck for small company in west michigan his wife gerrie was still working in the local school cafeteria but work for dave was scarce and the price of everything was rising the fusses were at risk of joining the millions of americans who have lost their homes in recent years then dave and gerrie received timely gift legacy from their neighbors ish and arlene hatch who died in an accident it really made difference when we were going under financially says dave but the fusses weren t the only folks in alto and the neighboring town of lowell to receive unexpected legacy from the hatches dozens of other families were touched by the hatches generosity in some cases it was few thousand dollars in others it was more than it

children men careers and what s happening in their lives when groups of men and women watch movie together the men usually end up telling the women to shut up men can either talk or watch the screen they can t do both and they don t understand that women can besides women consider that the point of all getting together is to have good time and develop relationships not just to sit there like couch potatoes staring at the screen during the ad breaks man often asks woman to explain the plot and tell him where the relationship between the characters is going he is unable unlike women to read the subtle body language signals that reveal how the characters are feeling emotionally since women originally spent their days with the other women and children in the group they developed the ability to communicate successfully in order to maintain relationships for woman speech continues to have such clear purpose to build relationships and make friends for men to talk is to relate the facts men see the telephone as communication tool for sending facts and information to other people but woman sees it as means of bonding woman can spend two weeks on vacation with her girlfriend and when she returns home telephone the same girlfriend and talk for another two hours there is no convincing evidence that social conditioning the fact that girls mothers talked to them more is the reason why girls talk more than boys psychiatrist dr michael lewis author of social behaviour and language acquisition conducted experiments that found mothers talked to and looked at baby girls more often than baby boys scientific evidence shows parents respond to the brain bias of their children since girl s brain is better organized to send and receive speech we therefore talk to them more consequently mothers who try to talk to their sons are usually disappointed to receive only short grunts in reply while watching tv with others women usually talk lot because they are afraid of awkward silence with their families and friends can both talk and watch the screen at the same time think they can have good time and develop relationships have to explain the plot and body language to their husbands after vacation with her girlfriend woman would talk to her again on the phone for hours in order to experience the happy time again keep close tie with her recommend her new scenic spot remind her of something forgotten woman sees it as means of bonding what does the author want to tell us most women s brains are better organized for language and communication women love to talk because they are more sociable than men men do not like talking because they rely more on facts social conditioning is not the reason why women love talking since girl s brain is better organized to send and receive speech which of the following would be the best title for the passage women are socially trained to talk talking maintains relationships women love to talk men talk differently from women when i was child i often dreamed of the time when i could leave home and escape to the city we lived on farm and in the winter especially we were quite cut off from the outside world as soon as i left school i packed my bags and moved to the capital however i soon discovered that city life has its problems too one big disadvantage is money it costs so much to go out not to mention basics like food and housing another disadvantage is pollution i suffer from asthma and at times the air is so bad that i am afraid to go outside then there is the problem of traveling round although i have car i seldom use it because of the traffic jams one choice is to go by bicycle but that can be quite dangerous of course there are advantages first there is so much to do in the city whatever your tastes in culture or entertainment besides there are wonderful jobs and greater chances of moving to more important job or position finally if you like shopping the variety of goods is very surprising and what is more shops are often only short walk away is life better then in the city perhaps it is when you are in your teens or twenties however as you get older and especially if you have small children the peace of the countryside may seem preferable i certainly hope to move back there soon what was the writer always thinking about when he was child staying on the farm moving to the countryside leaving home for the city running away from the school when i was child i often dreamed of the time when i could leave home and escape to the city which of the following is true about the writer he is very old now he is in good health he prefers driving car he lives in the city now however as you get older and especially if you have small children the peace of the countryside may seem preferable i certainly hope to move back there soon in the passage the writer tries to express his opinions about way of life describe his life in the countryside show an interest in the outside world persuade the reader to live in the city how is the passage mainly developed by inferring by comparing by listing examples by giving explanations i am writer i spend great deal of my time thinking about the power of language the way it can evoke an emotion visual image complex idea or simple truth language is the tool of my trade and i use them all all the englishes i grew up with born into chinese family that had recently arrived in california i ve been giving more thought to the kind of english my mother speaks like others i have described it to people as broken english but i feel embarrassed to say that it has always bothered me that i can think of no way to describe it other than broken as if it were damaged and needed to be fixed as if it lacked certain wholeness i ve heard other terms used limited english for example but they seem just as bad as if everything is limited including people s perceptions of the limited english speaker i know this for fact because when i was growing up my mother s limited english limited my perception of her i was ashamed of her english i believed that her english reflected the quality of what she had to say that is because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect and i had plenty of evidence to support me the fact that people in department stores at banks and at restaurants did not take her seriously did not give her good service pretended not to understand her or even acted as if they did not hear her i started writing fiction in and for reasons i won t get into today i began to write stories using all the englishes i grew up with the english she used with me which for lack of better term might be described as broken and what i imagine to be her translation of her chinese her internal language and for that i sought to preserve the essence but neither an english nor chinese structure i wanted to catch what language ability tests can never show her intention her feelings the rhythms of her speech and the nature of her thoughts by saying language is the tool of my trade the author means that she uses english in foreign trade she is fascinated by languages she works as translator she is writer by profession the tool of my trade trade the author used to think of her mother s english as impolite amusing imperfect practical because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect which of the following is true according to paragraph americans do not understand broken english the author s mother was not respected sometimes the author s mother had positive influence on her broken english always reflects imperfect thoughts the author gradually realizes her mother s english is well structured in the old style easy to translate rich in meaning what is the passage mainly about the change of the author s attitude to her mother s english the limitation of the author s perception of her mother the author s misunderstanding of limited english the author s experiences of using broken english tom was one of the brightest boys in the year with supportive parents but when he was he suddenly stopped trying he left school at with only two scores for secondary school subjects one of the reasons that made it cool for him not to care was the power of his peer group the lack of right male role models in many of their lives at home and particularly in the school environment means that their peers are the only people they have to judge themselves against they don t see men succeeding in society so it doesn t occur to them that they could make something of themselves without male teachers as role model the effect of peer actions and street culture is allpowerful boys want to be part of club however schools can provide the environment for change and provide the right role models for them teachers need to be trained to stop that but not in front of child s peers you have to do it one to one because that is when you see the real child it s pointless sending child home if he or she has done wrong they see it as welcome day off to watch television or play computer games instead schools should have special unit where child who has done wrong goes for the day and gets advice about his problemssomewhere he can work away from his peers and go home after the other children why did tom give up studying he disliked his teachers his parents no longer supported him it s cool for boys of his age not to care about studies there were too many subjects in his secondary school one of the reasons that made it cool for him not to care was the power of his peer group what seems to have bad effect on students like tom peer groups special unit the student judges the home environment their peers are the only people they have to judge themselves against what should schools do to help the problem schoolboys wait for their change patiently train leaders of their peer groups stop the development of street culture give them lessons in separate area instead schools should have special unit where child who has done wrong goes for the day and gets advice about his problems somewhere he can work away from his peers and go home after the other children teacher s work is most effective with schoolboy when he is with the boy alone teaches the boy lesson sends the boy home as punishment works together with another teacher you have to do it one to one because that is when you see the real child only three local students won chinese blog competition and of the awards went to students from china students task to get fullydesigned blog up and running complete with many postings based on theme of choice all written in chinese themes ranged from local opinions such as the usage of singlish education and whether singapore can be cultural centre to food blogs the entries were judged on language proficiency and the quality of writing as well as the design and level of exchanging ideas with readers academics from the national university of singapore and the sim university it experts and journalist from chinese newspaper lianhe zaobao in singapore made up the judges in the end only three singaporean students made it to the award list the rest of the awards were swept up by students from china no surprise said mr chow yaw long teacherincharge from innova junior college which organized the event although the topics were local subjects the foreign students were generally better in terms of the content of the posts and their grasp of the chinese language one of the three local students winning the first prize in the best language award was blogger christina gao from the saint andrew s junior college who spared no effort in researching for and writing her blog each entry took her between five and seven days to produce complete with pictures and even podcasts her advice for bloggers is be responsible some bloggers out there only seek to blame the authorities and other bloggers said miss gao i think they lack responsibilities and there is no value to their posts the competition was organized by the national university of singapore chinese newspaper lianhe zaobao innova junior college the saint andrew s junior college teacherincharge from innova junior college which organized the event which innova junior college which of the following is true according to the passage chinese students won most of the awards not all the themes were about local subjects the blogs could be written in chinese or singlish the judges were from universities in singapore and china what miss gao said suggests that she likes to blame the authorities she has sense of responsibility she thinks highly of the others blogs she loves to read valuable posts the passage is mainly about how chinese students won the awards in the competition why bloggers should take responsibility for their blogs how miss gao won the first prize in the competition what the result of the competition was five million people visit grand canyon in the us every year for

the main purpose of the text to provide travel information to report some recent news to teach tourists hiking skills to introduce the wild life for the purpose of helping project grand canyon for your fellow visitors and future generations please follow the guidelines below three years ago five parrots were set free in wild place of arizona thousands of miles from the channel islands in jersey where they had been looked after by zookeepers no evolutionary strategies informed them how to behave in this new landscape of mountainous pine forest unoccupied by their kind for years to the researchers surprise they failed to make contact with group of wild parrots imported from mexico and set free at the same time within hours the reintroducing ended in failure and the poor birds were back in cages on their way to the safety of the arizona reintroduction programme ever since then the programme has enjoyed great success mainly because the birds now being set free are mexican birds illegally caught in the wild confiscated on arrival north of the border and raised by their parents in the safety of the programme the experience shows how little we know about the behaviour and psychology of parrots as peter bennett bird researcher points out reintroducing species of high intelligence like parrots is lot more difficult people like parrots always treating them as nothing more than pets or valuable collectables now that many species of parrot are in immediate danger of dying out biologists are working together to study the natural history and the behaviour of this family of birds last year was an important turning point conservationists founded the world parrot trust based at hayle in cornwall to support research into both wild and caged birds research on parrots is vital for two reasons first as the arizona programme showed when reintroducing parrots to the wild we need to be aware of what the birds must know if they are to survive in their natural home we also need to learn more about the needs of parrots kept as pets particularly as the trust s campaign does not attempt to discourage the practice but rather urges people who buy parrots as pets to choose birds raised by humans what do we know about the area where the five parrots were reintroduced its landscape is new to parrots of their kind it used to be home to parrots of their kind it is close to where they had been kept pine trees were planted to attract birds the reintroducing experience three years ago shows that manraised parrots can find their way back home in jersey are unable to recognize their parents are unable to adapt to the wild can produce new species ever since then the programme has enjoyed great success mainly because the birds now being set free are mexican birds illegally caught in the wild why are researches on parrots important according to the passage the trust shows great concern for the programme we need to know more about how to preserve parrots many people are interested in collecting parrots parrots intelligence may some day benefit people according to the passage people are advised to treat wild and caged parrots equally to set up comfortable homes for parrots not to keep wild parrots as pets not to let more parrots go to the wild we also need to learn more about the needs of parrots kept as pets particularly as the trust s campaign does not attempt to discourage the practice but rather urges people who buy parrots as pets to choose birds raised by humans we also need to learn more about the needs of parrots kept as pets particularly as the trust s campaign does not attempt to discourage the practice but rather urges people who buy parrots as pets to choose birds raised by humans not but attempt to discourage the practice rather urges people who buy parrots urge sb to do sth intellectual property ip is product of the mind that has commercial value the concept dates back to when the first patent law to protect ip rights was passed ip rights protect an artist from having his her creative ideas copied by another for example if somebody generates an idea for novel that idea is protected by ip rights if someone else wishes to represent the idea or develop it further he she must consult the original artists who will normally be rewarded financially for its use back in the th century ip rights were primarily carried out to protect newly developed manufacturing processes against stealing but today intellectual property rights are also enjoyed by those who create music art and literature in recent years ip rights have been the focus of great deal of discussion because of technology which looks set to weaken them altogether the internet many years ago if you wanted recording of song you would have to purchase it from music store if novel from book store in those days ip rights were easily protected since it was very difficult to obtain intellectual property without paying for it however lot of ip including songs films books and artwork can be downloaded today free of charge using the internet this practice has now taken the world by storm dramatically affecting the way in which we view ip rights according to the writer in the beginning ip rights were mainly of use to those creating music art and literature novelists engineers and inventors those not receiving financial reward for their work what do we know about the internet according to the passage it makes ip rights harder to protect it sells songs and films it does not affect the way we understand ip rights it prevents the production of artwork because of technology which looks set to weaken them altogether according to paragraph what has taken the world by storm intellectual property rights the internet free downloading the large number of songs films and books this practice can be downloaded today free of charge using the internet possible title for this passage could be history of ip rights ways to protect your ip rights the present and the future of ip ip rights and our attitudes cities alarmed by deaths and injuries of pedestrians are taking efforts to make crosswalks safer for people on foot especially seniors and children who need more time to cross streets pedestrian is killed in traffic accident in the usa every minutes one is injured every nine minutes according to official data crosswalks can be especially dangerous for the elderly among people and older of pedestrian deaths in occurred in crosswalks compared with of those younger than according to the insurance institute for highway safety the federal highway administration fhwa advises that next year states increase by nearly the amount of time traffic lights provide for pedestrians to cross the street after the flashing orange hand appears fhwa spokesman doug hecox says reasons for the change include an aging population that needs more time to cross healthconscious americans walking more children encouraged to walk to prevent getting overweight and high gas prices pushing people to walk instead of drive pedestrian deaths went down by from in to in but among those in were killed in crosswalks down slightly from ten years earlier the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa says which of the following is true according to the text among pedestrian deaths there were people younger than old people are more likely to meet with accidents in crosswalks traffic accidents killed more old people than young people about seven traffic accidents happened per hour what is fhwa s suggestion to states fixing more traffic lights providing more crosswalks giving pedestrians more time to cross streets increasing the time before the orange lights appear fhwa what s the cause of the crosswalk safety problem according to the text there re many cars and buses on the road pedestrians are careless crosswalks are crowded drivers don t give way the report from nhtsa suggests that fewer people were injured in crosswalks crosswalk safety has been greatly improved much has been done to reduce traffic accidents pedestrian deaths in crosswalks remain serious problem nhtsa down slightly topping the class academically was certainly an advantage studying was breeze for nigel the reward was certainly incomparable to the little effort that he had to put in it began when he was selected to help the teachers in the computer laboratories the peak of his school career came not when he topped the school but when he was selected for the nationwide competition unlike everyone else nigel wanted to join the contest because he liked playing with the lego sets and making something out of them nigel spent the next two months rebuilding his robot it was during this time that nigel found out about the prizes for the competition as well as another competitor alicia from neighboring school his early intentions were forgotten getting the thousanddollar prize was more important than anything else nigel decided to befriend alicia unaware of his intentions she told him all about the robot that she had been building for the competition he even helped her to put the finishing touches to her robot he was glad with the way things had progressed his robot looked even better than alicia s and it was able to bounce ball with its arm something alicia had failed to do on the day of the competition he saw alicia everything dawned on her the minute she saw him among the competitors she stared at him puzzled at first then angry and finally look of helplessness came over her the flashbulbs of the camera exploded in nigel s face the robot had performed actions so unique and different that the specialists judgments were the same nigel was so pleased with himself that he did not even notice the girl standing few feet away from him without her he would never have won the competition what reward did nigel receive for doing well in his school work he was offered parttime job he was honored with scholarship he helped his teachers construct robot he helped in the computer laboratories it began when he was selected to help the teachers in the computer laboratories nigel s original intention of joining the contest was to be the top student of the school bring great honor to his school construct robot with the lego sets win the thousanddollar prize unlike everyone else nigel wanted to join the contest because he liked playing with the lego sets and making something out of them why did nigel help alicia finish her robot he tried to make friends with her he was fond of building robots he intended to help her he didn t want her to suspect him as well as another competitor alicia from neighboring school his early intentions were forgotten getting the thousanddollar prize was more important than anything else what is the author s attitude towards nigel s actions he is mildly critical he is strongly critical he is in favor of them his attitude is not clear studying was breeze for nigel the reward was certainly incomparable to the little effort that he had to put in dear friend the recent success of children s books has made the general public aware that there s huge market out there and there s growing need

descriptions of unicorns have been found dating from ancient times the great philosopher aristotle theorized that there were two types of unicorn the socalled indian ass and the oryx kind of antelope unicorns are often used in the logo of noble family town council or university as their special sign even scotland is represented by unicorn according to the legend anyone attempting to catch unicorn had to be extremely cautious as it has reputation for being very fierce clever trick suggested by unicorntrappers in order to catch this magnificent beast without being hurt by its horn was for the hunter to stand in front of tree and then to move quickly behind it as the unicorn charged hopefully the creature could then be captured when its horn was stuck in the tree when hollowed out and used as drinkingcup the unicorn s horn was said to have the power to offer protection against poison it was believed that nobody could be harmed by drinking the contents of unicorn s horn right up until the french revolution in the french court was said to have used cups made of unicorn horn in order to protect the king in addition the horn was said to have medicinal value so much so that it could be sold for more than ten times the price of the same weight of gold what then was unicorn horn we know at times the rhino was confused with this legendary creature drinkingcup supposedly made of unicorn horn was discovered to be made of the horn of rhino which of the following is true of the unicorn it was not historically recorded its horn was first used in france it was similar to the indian ass and the oryx it could be the symbol of university unicorns are often used in the logo of noble family town council or university as their special sign to catch unicorn the unicorntrappers had to try all of the following except tempting the unicorn to attack making use of the tree as protection hiding quickly behind the unicorn having the unicorn horn stuck in the tree the last paragraph is mainly about the properties of the unicorn horn the users of the unicorn horn the price of the unicorn horn the comparison between the unicorn horn and the rhino horn the unicorn s horn was said to have the power to offer protection against poison in the last paragraph the word unicorn is in quotation marks because the cup is designed only for royal family the unicorn does not exist in reality the unicorn is the rarest animal in the world the medicinal value of the horn is appreciated western new bridge library announcement shortened library hours for spring break library hours have been

children the school children volunteers of the activities ms tan you ve referred to your new novel as your eighth book that s because it took me six or seven attempts at second novel before i started and completed this one why do you think you had so many false starts i would say that my reasons were wrong i was trying to prove that i wasn t just mother daughter storyteller or i was trying to prove that i didn t just have to write about things that were strictly chinese or chinese american those were never the right reasons for writing those early stories and i could never come up with other better reasons for continuing them what kept you going on this book this book was different because it was based on my mother s real life the reason for writing it became more personal and emotional after the joy luck club came out my mother was always explaining to people that she wasn t any of the mothers in that book and at one point she said to me next book tells my true story and then she started telling me things i never knew before she also told me many many stories because my mother doesn t generalize the book really grew out of that have you ever visited china yes i ve been there twice about three years ago and then again last november both times with my mother and my husband was it difficult to capture the chinese american dialect without sounding like parody no because it s the language i ve heard all my life from my mother she speaks english as it s direct translation from chinese but it s more than that her language also has more imagery than english can you think of an example somebody might say to me don t work so hard you ll kill yourself my mother will say to me why do you press all your brains out on this page for someone else so it s very vivid that s the way she talks have many readers told you that the chinese mother in your book reminded them of the typical jewish mother many people have told me that i think the mother daughter relationship is very intense in both cases culturally there is an acceptance that mothers have the power to tell their children especially their daughters how to conduct their lives not simply up until the time they are but for the rest of their lives however when children grow up in different culture from their parents they tend to keep more secrets from their parents the children think they just wouldn t understand that i had to do this and that can really create gap and it can grow as the number of secrets grows ms tan based on the questions in this interview what do you think ms tan s profession is journalist storywriter an interviewer an interviewee your new novel second novel ms tan profession what s true about tan s second book it s about her real life in america the name of the book is the joy luck club it is the result of many times of careful thought it includes many works of her mother it took me six or seven attempts at second novel before i started and completed this one tan which question is not answered in the interview how does she think of her mother s language how many books does she plan to write when did she visit china how is generation gap created we can infer that tan s mother is good storyteller tan plans to write another book about her mother tan plans to return to china tan s mother is hard to communicate with because of personality she also told me many many stories because my mother doesn t generalize so it s very vivid that s the way she talks tan the last paragraph mainly talks about how to keep secrets from parents how to deal with the mother daughter relationship how to conduct the lives how the generation gap comes about luck is matter of preparation meeting opportunity said the american talk show host oprah winfrey i ve never watched her show but when self made billionaire gives life advice it s probably worth listening to her point is that blind luck is very rare you may have to be lucky to find good job these days but that does not mean you should sit at home waiting for the opportunity to come to you if you re chinese you may already be familiar with the tale of farmer waiting by tree stump for rabbit to run out and break its neck book by the uk psychologist richard wiseman called the luck factor argues we can all make ourselves luckier it s not about going to temple to burn some incense in hopes that the gods will give you good fortune it s practical advice you can follow each day wiseman conducted an experiment as part of his studies first he divided volunteers into two groups those who said they were lucky in life and those who said they were not he gave everyone newspaper and asked them to look through it to count how many photographs it had inside on average the unlucky people took about two minutes to count the photographs while the lucky people took just seconds why on the second page of the newspaper command stop counting there are photographs in this newspaper was written in big letters the unlucky people mostly did not spot the message it s easy to compare this situation to young person looking for jobs in local paper they might search so hard for one type of position that they miss an even better opportunity people who are lucky in fact keep an open mind and don t go through the same routine every day i first came to china in when it was considered rather strange thing to do like many foreigners my plan was to teach english for one year seven years later and still here i ve had many great opportunities such as writing for newspapers and magazines i did not dream these would have been possible i ve also never been sick had an accident got into fight or had problems with the police coincidence after reading about professor wiseman s studies i think not as wiseman advises i usually trust my own judgment your friends and parents may give you advice based on rational thinking but it s important to consider how you feel about each choice you make your feeling acts as warning for potential problem finally try to turn bad luck into good even if you do fall down and break leg the time spent at home can be used wisely to study english which of the following proverbs most agrees with the writer s point make the best of bad job rome was not built in day all is not gold that glitters good heart conquers ill fortune make the best of bad job try to turn bad luck into good rome was not built in day all is not gold that glitters good heart conquers ill fortune what do you know about oprah winfrey she became famous through her family background she was very lucky and seldom suffered setbacks in her life she is british talk show host she became successful by her own effort self made billionaire talk show oprah winfrey the writer quoted the chinese tale of farmer in order to show luck is in your own hand bad luck can turn into good you should not sit at home waiting for the opportunity to come to you man can conquer nature from the experiment wiseman drew the conclusion that lucky people are quick minded unlucky people are slow to read lucky people often have an open mind unlucky people are more creative wiseman the underlined word spot is the closest in meaning to recognize mark locate receive the unlucky people mostly did not spot the message spot you may have to be lucky to find good job these days but that does not mean you should sit at home waiting for the opportunity to come to you but to find good job waiting for the opportunity to come to you can you believe your eyes recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age martin doherty psychologist at the university of stirling in scotland led the team of scientists in this experiment doherty and his team tested the perception of some people using pictures of some orange circles the researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people the first group included children aged to and the second group included adults aged to the first group of pictures showed two circles alone on white background one of the circles was larger than the other and these people were asked to identify the larger one four year olds identified the correct circle percent of the time adults identified the correct circle percent of the time next both groups were shown picture where the orange circles again of different sizes were surrounded by gray circles here s where the trick lies in in some of the pictures the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle which was the real larger one and the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle when young children aged to looked at these tricky pictures they weren t fooled they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before older children and adults on the other hand did not do as well older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one and adults got it wrong most of the time as children get older doherty said their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context in other words they will begin to process the whole picture at once the tricky gray circles as well as the orange circle in the middle as result they re more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick doherty and his team of scientists did an experiment to evaluate children s and adults eye sight people s ability to see accurately children s and adults brains the influence of people s age when asked to find the larger circle children at got it wrong of the time with no gray ones around only adults over got it right of the time with gray ones around children at got it right about of the time with gray ones around adults got it right most of the time with gray ones around according to the passage we can know that smaller orange circle appears bigger on white background an orange circle appears bigger than gray one of the same size circle surrounded by other circles looks bigger than its real size circle surrounded by bigger ones looks smaller than its real size visual context may work when children get older than why are younger children not fooled because they are smarter than older children and adults because older people are influenced by their experience because people s eyes become weaker as they grow older because their brain can hardly notice related things together bill fulton doesn t remember losing his wallet but its return helped him

wherever they go people turn out in their thousands to greet them the crowds go wild trying to catch brief glimpse of their smiling colorfully dressed idols the stars are transported in their chauffeur driven rollsroyces private helicopters or executive aeroplanes they are surrounded by permanent entourage of managers press agents and bodyguards photographs of them appear regularly in the press and all their comings and goings are reported for like royalty pop stars are news if they enjoy many of the privileges of royalty they certainly share many of the inconveniences as well it is dangerous for them to make unscheduled appearances in public they must be constantly shielded from the adoring crowds who idolize them they are no longer private individuals but public property the financial rewards they receive for this sacrifice cannot be calculated for their rates of pay are great and why not society has always rewarded its top entertainers lavishly the great days of hollywood have become legendary famous stars enjoyed fame wealth and adulation on an alltime scale by today s standards the excesses of hollywood do not seem quite so spectacular single gramophone record nowadays may earn much more in royalties than the films of the past ever did the competition for the title top of the pops is fierce but the rewards are truly huge it is only right that the stars should be paid in this way don t the top men in industry earn enormous salaries for the service they perform to their companies and their countries pop stars earn vast sums in foreign currency often more than large industrial companies and the taxman can only be grateful for their massive annual contributions to the exchequer so who would begrudge them their rewards it s all very well for people in boring jobs to complain about the successes and rewards of others people who make envious remarks should remember that the most famous stars represent only the tip of the iceberg for every famous star there are hundreds of others struggling to earn living man working in steady job and looking forward to pension at the end of it has no right to expect very high rewards he has chosen security and peace of mind so there will always be limit to what he can earn but man who attempts to become star is taking enormous risks he knows at the outset that only handful of competitors ever get to the very top he knows that years of concentrated effort may be rewarded with complete failure but he knows too that the rewards for success are very high indeed they are the payback for the huge risks involved and once he makes it he will certainly earn them that s the essence of private enterprise the author develops the passage mainly by comparing different ideas giving explanations inferring listing typical examples the underlined word begrudge in the third paragraph is closest in meaning to be jealous of be satisfied with be anxious about be crazy about according to the passage which of the following can match the view of the author he who laughs last laughs best if you venture nothing you will gain nothing he who makes no mistakes makes nothing success belongs to the persevering if you venture nothing you will gain nothing the author holds n attitude towards the high income of pop stars critical approval optimistic indifferent which of the following is true according to the passage people are blind in idolizing stars there is fierce competition in becoming pop stars the government taxes pop stars very little pop stars life is more luxurious than that of royalty he knows at the outset that only handful of competitors ever get to the very top do american children still learn handwriting in school in the age of the keyboard some people seem to think handwriting lessons are on the way out of teachers say they are required to teach handwriting but studies have yet to answer the question of how well they are teaching it one study published this year found that about three out of every four teachers say they are not prepared to teach handwriting some teachers are teaching handwriting by providing instruction for minutes day and then other teachers who basically teach it for to minutes day which really for handwriting is pretty much many adults remember learning that way by copying letters over and over again today s thinking is that short periods of practice are better many experts also think handwriting should not be taught by itself instead they say it should be used as way to get students to express ideas after all that is why we write handwriting involves two skills one is legibility which means forming the letters so they can be read the other is fluency writing without having to think about it fluency continues to develop up until high school but not everyone masters these skills teachers commonly report that about onefourth of their kids have poor handwriting some people might think handwriting is not important any more because of computers and voice recognition programs but steve graham at vanderbilt says word processing is rarely done in elementary school especially in the early years american children traditionally first learn to print and then to write in cursive which connects the letters but guess what we learned from spokeswoman for the college board which administers the sat college admission test more than percent of students choose to print their essay on the test rather than write in cursive we can learn from paragraph teaching handwriting is basic requirement in teaching job most teachers prefer to teach handwriting teachers spend little time in teaching handwriting keyboard has taken the place of the handwriting entirely of teachers say they are required to teach handwriting one study published this year found that about three out of every four teachers say they are not prepared to teach handwriting which of the following is wrong for traditional handwriting in the usa the students are taught by practicing long period the letters are repeated many times handwriting includes two skills to write in cursive is taught first the underlined word legibility in paragraph means easy to read complex unexpected unreadable which means forming the letters so they can be read the best title for the passage is how to improve handwriting in school right or wrong the death of handwriting handwriting involves two skills handwriting lessons are on the way out the author s attitude towards whether still to learn handwriting in school is negative objective critical optimistic one study published this year found that about three out of every four teachers say they are not prepared to teach handwriting published this year found they are not prepared to teach handwriting you know how wonderful you are and you know that others know how wonderful you are but what do you do when admiration crosses over the line into jealousy for most teens there will come day when you realize that one of your friends is jealous and that this jealousy is hurting your friendship when this happens it can seem like there is nothing that you can do but the good news is that there is don t let jealousy spoil your relationships tackle it headon and you might be back to normal much sooner than you think it can be hard to walk up to friend and ask them what the problem is but if you want to save your friendship you ll have to do just that don t approach them and ask why they are jealous of you unless of course you want to appear totally conceited just take some time alone with them and let them know that you ve been feeling like there s been something coming between you if they refuse to respond then use the opportunity to explain how you have been feeling chances are that something you say will strike nerve and your friend will open up as well when you figure out what is annoying your friend ask him or her what s he thinks would make the situation better if for example s he says that s he feels like s he doesn t get to spend any time with you because of your being off with your new friends from tee swim team then maybe you could invite her along the next time or block off one day week for just the two of you remember though that whatever solution you decide on should be compromise don t limit your own talents or opportunities simply because your friend is unhappy try instead to include him or her in your new life and see how that works out even the best of friendships can be tinged by jealousy this destructive emotion is rarely productive and can turn best friends into worst enemies before taking extreme action chat with your jealous friend to see if the two of you can work out compromise if you can t be prepared to know exactly how far you will go to keep your friendand how far you won t according to the author the jealousy emotion is normal productive destructive extreme that this jealousy is hurting your friendship which of the following is not mentioned as way to confront your friend when jealousy happens walking up to him her and asking him her why he she is jealous of you walking up to him her and asking him her what the problem is spending some time with him her and letting him her know how you feel spending some time with him her and letting him her know you think there s something between you don t approach them and ask why they are jealous of you the underlined it in the first paragraph refers to friendship relationship admiration jealousy what can be inferred from the last two paragraphs there s always solution to solve the problem of jealousy jealousy can turn best friends into worst enemies you may lose friend to keep your own gifts chances or self development you should go long way with your friend to work out solution the purpose of the passage is to explain what causes jealousy to offer some advice on making friends to introduce the way to cope with jealous friend to explain how destructive the jealous emotion is honesty comes in many forms first there s self honesty is what people see the real article or do you appear through smoke and mirrors i find that if i try to be something i m not i feel unsure of myself and take out part from my pba personal bank account i love how singer judy garland put it always be firstclass version of yourself instead of secondclass version of somebody else then there s honesty in our actions are you honest at school with your parents and with your boss if you ve ever been dishonest i think we all have try being honest and notice how whole it makes you feel remember you can t do wrong and feel right this story by jeff is good example of that in my second year of study there were three kids in my math class who didn t do well i was really good at it i would charge them three dollars for each test that i helped them pass i write on little piece of paper all the right answers and hand them off at first i felt like i was making money kind of nice job i wasn t thinking about how it could hurt all of us after while i realized i shouldn t do that anymore because i wasn t really helping them they weren t learning anything and it would only get harder down the road cheating certainly wasn t helping me it takes courage to be honest when people all around you are getting away with cheating on tests lying to their parents and stealing at work but remember every act of honesty is deposit into your pba and will build strength the underlined part appear through smoke and mirrors in the first paragraph means to be honest to he unreal to become clear to come from an imagined world appear through smoke and mirrors to be unreal which of the following can best explain judy garland s words be your true self rather than follow others don t copy others or you can t be the first class make efforts to be the first instead of the second don t learn from others unless they re excellent what does the author expect to show by jeff s story honesty can be of great help bad thing can be turned into good one helping others cheat can do good to nobody one should realize the wrong in his bad deeds jeff in the last paragraph the author mainly wants to express one must be brave to be honest it s difficult to be honest when others are not one should be honest when making deposit honesty in one s actions can help him in the future teenagers who drink alcohol are at higher risk of becoming victims of violence cardiff university study has found team from the school of dentistry s violence research group studied drinking habits in children aged in england they found not only link between drink and violence but also that children who drank were more likely to be hit even if they weren t violent themselves the researchers are now calling for measures to prevent alcohol misuse to reduce injury risk current policy focuses on reducing aggression but this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization more than children were surveyed at schools at four local authorities in the north the midlands london and the south the study found that of year olds were drinking monthly and daily with admitting to getting drunk to times year by the age of were drinking weekly and were drinking every day the research also showed of year olds were getting drunk more than times year the study which has just been published in the journal of adolescence found strong link between frequency of drinking and frequency of hitting other people however children who reported drinking monthly were also three times more likely to be hit adolescents who drank but didn t get into fights were more likely to be hit than those who did fight professor jonathan shepherd who led the research said lot of previous alcohol related violence work had focused on the offenders rather than the victims his team is calling for more prevention work from parents and teachers in the first two years of secondary school by taking advantage of the teachable moment that is immediately after student has missed school because of drunkenness previous work by professor jonathan shepherd has shown drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of reduced physical co ordination poor decision making in threatening situations and isolation while out late at night he said this new study seems to be the first to show direct link between alcohol misuse and victimization there now needs to he much more effort put into reducing alcohol misuse in order to reduce injury the main idea of the passage is that teenagers who drink alcohol often offend other people often become injured are more likely to become victims of violence are more likely to fight with others teenagers who drink alcohol are at higher risk of becoming victims of violence the underlined word aggression in the third paragraph probably means violence sad feelings bad manners drunkenness aggression victimization aggression the research argues that more effort should be made to reduce aggression prevent fighting reduce victimization prevent drinking alcohol this research shows that there should be equal effort to reduce victimization drinkers may be more at risk of violence because of all the following except reduced physical co ordination isolation while out late at night higher frequency of hitting other people poor decision making in threatening situations which of the following statements is not true according to professor shepherd s research the frequency of children getting drunk increases with age his previous alcohol related violence work had focused on the offenders some children missed school because of drunkenness this new study shows direct link between alcohol misuse and victimization lot of previous alcohol related violence work had focused on the offenders audrey hepburn won an academy award as best actress for her first major american movie roman holiday which was released in but she is remembered as much for her aid work as for her acting born in belgium in audrey s father was british and her mother was dutch audrey was sent to live at british school for part of her childhood during world war ii she lived and studied in the netherlands her mother thought it would be safe from german attacks audrey studied dance as teenager and during college when she returned to london after the war but she realized she wasn t going to be ballerina so she began taking acting parts in stage shows later she began to get small parts in movies but it was audrey hepburn s move to america that brought her true fame in she played the character gigi in the broadway play of the same name to great critical praise two years later roman holiday made her star at the age of audrey made more than movies among her most popular

unicef projects audrey hepburn often said her loyalty to unicef was the result of her experiences as child during world war she said she knew what it was like to be starving and to be saved by international aid she was goodwill ambassador until her death in from colon cancer audrey hepburn in paragraph her aid work means winning an academy award as best actress taking acting parts in stage shows making movies acting as goodwill ambassador for unicef the reason why audrey lived and studied in the netherlands was that she wanted to be ballerina her parents were from britain the education there was excellent it was safe there her mother thought it would be safe from german attacks she returned to london after the war we can infer from the passage that audrey s parents lived in germany during world war audrey lived in america in the s audrey was made to give up dancing the character gigi in the broadway play was her most popular role she realized she wasn t going to be ballerina in she played the character gigi in the broadway play is not mentioned in the passage about audrey hepburn marriage identity contribution religion is the right order for audrey s life the first time she

campaign to dispel widespread rumors fueled by the internet and new hollywood movie the latest big screen offering from sony picture arrives in theaters on friday with milliondollar production about the end of the world supposedly based on myths backed by the mayan calendar it is claimed that the end of time will come as planet x or nibiru heads toward or collides with the earth some websites accuse nasa of hiding the truth on the planet s existence but the us space agency denounced such stories as an internet hoax there is no factual basis for these claims nasa said in questionandanswer posting on its website if such collision were real astronomers would have been tracking it for at least the past decade and it would be visible by now to the naked eye obviously it does not exist credible scientists worldwide know of no threat associated with it insisted after all our planet has been getting along just well for more than four billion years added nasa there is another planet eris floating in space but the small planet similar to pluto will remain safely fixed in the outer solar system and it can come no closer than four billion miles to the earth according to nasa initial theories set the disaster for may but when nothing happened the date was moved forward to the winter in to coincide with the end of cycle of the ancient mayan calendar nasa insisted the mayan calendar in fact does not end on december as another period begins immediately afterward and even if the planets were to line up as some have forecast the effect on our planet would be negligible nasa said and while comets and asteroids have always hit the earth big hits are very rare nasa noted the last major impact was believed to be million years ago resulting in the end of dinosaurs we have already determined that there are no threatening asteroids as large as the one that killed the dinosaurs the space agency said x played key role in the spread of the rumors new book the internet and new hollywood movie nasa an indian calendar to dispel widespread rumors fueled by the intermet and new hollywood movie the film is about the end of the world based on the scientific prediction well accepted in the science field about romantic love story based on myths we can infer that people didn t take the rumor seriously planet x or nibiru does exist astronomers have been tracking planet x for over ten years the rumor caused panic among some people the us space agency insisted monday in rare campaign to dispel widespread rumors nasa thinks that eris might pose threat to the earth doesn t pose any threat to the earth is too far away to be visible is similar to our planet where life might exist eris which of the following is the best title new hollywood movie december not the end of the world end of the ancient mayan calendar how rumors came into being the latest big screen offering from sony picture arrives in theaters on friday with milliondollar production about the end of the world supposedly based on myths backed by the mayan calendar the latest big screen offering with supposedly based on myths the end of the world backed by the mayan calendar myths angus macleod was fifty and he had spent his entire life as shepherd in the remote mountainous region of northwest scotland he had never owned radio or television nor had he travelled further than forty kilometres from his birthplace his knowledge of the world was gained only from his brief trips to the village to sell his sheep and buy food however he had lately come to rely on the growing number of hillwalkers in the region as sources of international news in the spring of spanish student came across angus high in the mountains eager to practise his english he engaged angus in conversation the student told angus of the forthcoming olympic games in barcelona excited by the student s colourful description of spain and the games angus decided to attend the event in person and two months later arrived in barcelona the ticketless angus stood outside the stadium with his canny brain working overtime watching growing number of individuals entering the stadium through small entrance at the side he noticed that they all seemed to be carrying objects perhaps they were workmen he thought he moved closer and watched within minutes thin young man came along carrying an extremely long pole he approached the official at the door and said pole vault the official moved to the side and the man entered next came heavyset man with spear angus wondered how man could carry such dangerous weapon in modern city the man shouted javelin and was presently admitted angus was puzzled perhaps they were all connected with security his puzzlement grew when huge man appeared with steel ball in his hand he shouted shot putt and walked past the official it suddenly dawned on angus that these people were competitors he opened his programme and sure enough under the heading events he saw the three words the men had said angus laughed to himself as plan began to take shape in his mind first he needed to buy one or two things an hour later he reappeared dressed in tracksuit with scotland written across the chest over his shoulder he carried roll of barbed wire smiling to himself he walked up to the official and as casually as he could shouted fencing which was angus new way of getting information about the outside world travelling from his birthplace listening to radio and watching tv going to the nearby village to sell sheep talking to hillwalkers in the region what are javelin pole vault shot putt and fencing in the passage olympic events names of competitors security weapons names of countries from the passage we can learn that more and more people went to scotland to practise their english the spanish student s description of his country excited angus angus had been planning trip to barcelona to see the olympic games angus became member of the scottish olympic team from the passage we know that angus seemed to be poorlyinformed intelligent strongminded athletic what do you expect the official would do in the end help him carry the wire refuse to let him in give him close inspection lead him to the competition in the quest for better health many people turn to doctors selfhelp books or herbal supplements but they overlook powerful weapon that could help them fight illness and depression speed recovery slow aging and prolong life their friends researchers are only now starting to pay attention to the importance of friendship and social networks in overall health year australian study found that older people with large circle of friends were percent less likely to die during the study period than those with fewer friends large study showed an increase of nearly percent in the risk for obesity among people whose friends gained weight and last year harvard researchers reported that strong social ties could promote brain health as we age in general the role of friendship in our lives isn t well appreciated said rebecca g adams professor of sociology at the university of north carolina greensboro there are lot of things on families and marriage but very little on friendship it baffles me friendship has bigger impact on our psychological wellbeing than family relationships bella depaulo visiting psychology professor at the university of california santa barbara whose work focuses on single people and friendships notes that in many studies friendship has an even greater effect on health than spouse or family member it isn t entirely clear why friendship has such big effect it may be because people with strong social ties also have better access to health services and care beyond that however friendship clearly has profound psychological effect people with strong friendships are less likely than others to get colds perhaps because they have lower stress levels last year researchers studied students at the university of virginia taking them to the base of steep hill and fitting them with weighted backpack they were then asked to estimate the steepness of the hill some participants stood next to friends during the exercise while others were alone the students who stood with friends gave lower estimates of the steepness of the hill and the longer the friends had known each other the less steep the hill appeared people with stronger friendship networks feel like there is someone they can turn to said karen roberto director of the center for gerontology at virginia tech friendship is an undervalued resource the consistent message of these studies is that friends make your life better what s the main idea of the passage people should make friends as many as possible friendships do great good to human health people with friends have optimistic attitude several studies have been done on friendships which of the following is true people haven t attached importance to friendships friend can replace doctors and selfhelp books people with many friends may have higher stress levels people who have friends tend to be fat the author mentioned the study in the last three paragraphs to indicate that students should climb the steep hill with friends it takes long time to make friends friend in need is friend indeed people accompanied by friends remain optimistic in the face of difficulty the students who stood with friends gave lower estimates of the steepness of the hill in paragraph the author aims to tell us friendship has strong physical effect on people s health we cannot be too careful when making friends older people are likely to have fewer friends percent of the people without friends will become fat when they get old according to karen roberto the effect of friendships is overvalued studies on friendships make our life better friends are more important than family members friends can help each other when faced with problems but they overlook powerful weapon that could help them fight illness and depression speed recovery slow aging and prolong life their friends that powerful weapon their friends powerful weapon bella depaulo visiting psychology professor at the university of california santa barbara whose work focuses on single people and friendships notes that in many studies friendship has an even greater effect on health than spouse or family member visiting psychology professor at the university of california santa barbara della depaulo whose work focuses on bella depaulo notes sesame street has been called the longest street in the world that is because the television program by that name can now be seen in so many parts of the world that program became one of american s exports soon after it went on the air in new york in in the united states more than six million children watch the program regularly the viewers include more than half the nation s pre school children from every kind of economic racial and geographical group although some educators object to certain elements in the program parents praise it highly many teachers also consider it great help though some teachers find that problems arise when first graders who have learned from sesame street are in the same class with children who have not watched the program tests have shown that children from all racial geographical and economic backgrounds have benefited from watching it those who watch it five times week learn more than occasional viewers in the us the program is shown at different hours during the week in order to increase the number of children who can watch it regularly the programs all use songs stories jokes and pictures to give children basic understanding of numbers letters and human relationships but there are some differences for example the spanish program produced in mexico city devotes more time to teaching whole words than to teaching separate letters why has sesame street been so much more successful than other children s shows many reasons have been suggested people mention the educational theories of its creators the support by the government and private businesses and the skillful use of variety of tv tricks perhaps an equally important reason is that mothers watch it along with their children this is partly because famous adult stars often appear on it but the best reason for the success of the program may be that it makes every child watching feel able to learn the child finds himself learning and he wants to learn more sesame street is actually street in the us program for children program for teachers program for students children who often watch the program can have problems in school will find it great help will take no interest in their studies will be well educated what is special about the program it offers great fun it makes children feel able to learn it is shown at different hours during the week children learn and enjoy themselves while watching why is sesame street so popular in the world because it is supported by the government and businesses because it uses variety of skillful tricks because mothers watch it along with their children because it makes every child watching it feel able to learn the best title for this passage can be tv programs educating children sesame street great success sesame street more than six million children watch the program regularly tests have shown that children have benefited from watching it the programs all use songs stories jokes and pictures to give children basic understanding of numbers letters and human relationships the best reason for the success of the program may be that it makes every child watching feel able to learn sesame street ruben lived in small village there was no school there and he had to study in school in

wants to show that he ll run faster than me but he s fallen behind ruben had to run to school because he had no bike he hoped to win some medals his village was little far from the school he was afraid to be late for class so he won some medals ruben is good at running ruben went to school on time ruben often took part in the sports meetings ruben likes to have race with others the phrase chemist s shop in the story means ruben s money was stolen on his way to the town before he went in the shop when he was waiting in the shop after he had left the shop ruben was happy because he could easily catch the thief he had chance to have race he knew who had stolen his money he would win another medal that day ruben ruben ruben was world conservation year the united nations wanted everyone to know that the world was in danger they hoped that the governments would act quickly in order to conserve nature here is one example of the problem at one time there were different plants trees and flowers in holland but now only remain the others have been destroyed by modern man and his technology we are changing the earth the air and the water and everything that grows and lives we can t live without these things if we continue like this we shall destroy ourselves what will happen in the future perhaps it is more important to ask what must we do now the people who will be living in the world of tomorrow are the young of today lot of them know that conservation is necessary many are hoping to save our world they plant trees build bridges across rivers in forests and so on in small town in the united states large group of girls cleaned the banks of eleven kilometres of their river young people may hear about conservation through record called no one s going to change our world it was made by scatles cliff richard and other singers the money from it will help to conserve wild animals there are few plants trees and flowers in holland now because there has been lot of conservation in holland holland does not need so many plants trees and flowers many plants trees and flowers don t grow there any more some plants trees and flowers are dangerous we shall destroy ourselves if we don t improve our technology in planting trees hear about the record called no one s going to change our world try our best to save the world change the earth no one s going to change our world was an important book published in record calling on people to conserve nature an idea that nobody would accept rule worked out by the united states what is the most important thing for us to do to save our world we should clean the banks of our rivers we should know what will happen in the future we should know what we should do and do it now we should plant more trees and flowers what s the main idea of the passage was world conservation year the united nations wanted everybody to know that the world is in danger conservation is necessary it is the young people who are helping to save our world we can t live without these things if we continue like this we shall destroy ourselves young people may hear about conservation through record called no one s going to change our world lot of them know that conservation is necessary five years ago david smith wore an expensive suit to work every day i was clothes addict he jokes i used to carry fresh suit to work with me so i could change if my clothes got wrinkled today david wears casual clothes khaki pants and sports shirt to the office he hardly ever wears necktie i m working harder than ever david says and i need to feel comfortable more and more companies are allowing their office workers to wear casual clothes to work in the united states the change from formal to casual office wear has been gradual in the early s many companies allowed their employees to wear casual clothes on friday but only on friday this became known as dress down friday of casual friday what started out as an extra one day week benefit for employees has really become an everyday thing said business consultant maisly jones why have so many companies started allowing their employees to wear casual clothes one reason is that it s easier for company to attract new employees if it has casual dress code lot of young people don t want to dress up for work says the owner of software company so it s hard to hire people if you have conservative dress code another reason is that people seem happier and more productive when they are wearing comfortable clothes in study conducted by levi strauss and company percent of employers said that they believe that casual dress improves employee morale only percent of employers said that casual dress has negative impact on productivity supporters of casual office wear also argue that casual dress code helps them save money suits are expensive if you have to wear one every day one person said for the same amount of money you can buy lot more casual clothes david smith refers to himself as having been clothes addict because he often wore khaki pants and sports shirt he couldn t stand clean appearance he wanted his clothes to look neat all the time he didn t want to spend much money on clothes david smith wears casual clothes now because they make him feel at ease when working he cannot afford to buy expensive clothes he looks handsome in casual clothes he no longer works for any company according to this passage which of the following statements is false many employees don t like conservative dress code comfortable clothes make employees more productive casual clothes code is welcomed by young employees all the employers in the u s are for casual office wear according to this passage which of the following statements is true company workers started to dress down about twenty years ago dress down has become an everyday phenomenon since the early s dress down friday was first given as favor from employers many workers want to wear casual clothes to impress people in this passage the following advantages of casual office wear are mentioned in the passage except saving employees money making employees more attractive improving employees motivation making employees happier i m working harder than ever david says and i need to feel comfortable only percent of employers said that casual dress has negative impact on productivity what started out as an extra one day week benefit for employees has really become an everyday thing mankind is still evolving according to recent study by team of scientists led by yale university evolutionary biologist but research suggests that the natural selection process is no longer driven by survival perhaps because of differences in women s fertility the team examined women in framingham massachusetts the us and studied the medical histories of some residents since they found that strong slightly fat women tend to have more children and if this trend were to continue for the next generations by the average woman would be cm shorter kg heavier and have healthier heart that rate of evolution is pretty similar to what we see in plants and animals humans don t seem to be any exception the team said other recent genetic research backs up that belief one study by john hawks an anthropologist at the university of wisconsin at madison found that some human gene variations are common in recent generations because of evolution among the changes are mutations that allow people to digest milk or resist malaria and others that govern brain development since the industrial revolution modern humans have grown taller and stronger it s easy to assume that evolution is making humans fitter but according to anthropologist peter mcallister the contemporary male has evolved physically into the sorriest example of male ever on the planet an average neanderthal woman mcallister notes could have beat arnold schwarzenegger in an armwrestling match and early australian aborigines could easily defeat usain bolt in m dash however douglas ewbank of the university of pennsylvania says that cultural factors tend to have much greater impact than natural selection on future generations so people tend to ignore evolution s effects and despite evidence indicating evolution still works steve jones an evolutionary biologist at university college london thinks that the impact of evolution on humans is not the most important what makes humans what we are is in our minds in our society and not in our evolution said jones what does the underlined sentence humans don t seem to be any exception imply plants and animals are evolving faster than humans evolution doesn t work in humans any longer the rate of evolution in plants and animals also applies to humans humans are unique in their evolution why is the recent genetic research quoted in the fifth paragraph to support the belief that mankind is still evolving to show human gene variations are common in recent generations to prove modern humans have grown fitter to suggest that the natural selection process is no longer driven by survival other recent genetic research backs up that belief according to the passage we can infer that arnold schwarzenegger used to be famous actor is an american governor is very weak is very strong according to douglas ewbank which of the following factors plays greater part in the future generations culture evolution natural selection genetic mutations what is the main idea of the passage mankind is still evolving women will get fatter the history of human evolution future women tend to have more children among the changes are mutations that allow people to digest milk or resist malaria and others that govern brain development mutations and others that allow people to digest milk or resist malaria mutations that govern brain development others and despite evidence indicating evolution still works steve jones an evolutionary biologist at university college london thinks that the impact of evolution on humans is not the most important steve jones an evolutionary biologist at university college london steve jones that despite evidence evidence thursday july healthday news new study that found that lowercalorie diet slowed the aging process in monkeys could be the best proof yet that restricted diets might do the same for humans the big question in aging research is will caloric restriction in species closely related to humans slow aging said richard weindruch senior author of paper appearing in the july issue of science this is the first clear demonstration that in primate species we re inducing slowdown of the aging process showing increased survival resistance to disease less brain atrophy and less muscle loss this predicts humans would respond similarly added weindruch professor of medicine at the university of wisconsin and an investigator at the veterans hospital in madison another expert noted that despite some highly publicized studies in certain species the link between restricted eating and longer lifespan has been far from proven the idea that dietary restriction extends lifespan in all species is not true many strains of rats and mice do not respond in some strains it s actually deleterious explained felipe sierra director of the biology of aging program at the us national institute on aging nia which supported the new study the fact that it doesn t work in some mice but it does seem to work in monkeys is surprising and it gives us hope but there s larger question how to change humans increasingly lax eating habits this finding doesn t give me hope that humans are going to go into dietary restriction added marianne grant registered dietitian at texas m health science center coastal bend health education center in corpus christi the underlined word restricted means limited satisfied reserved fascinated which of the following statements about weindruch is true this experiment indicates restricted diets could extend humans lifespan adequate sleep is another way to reduce the speed of aging process the experiment was failure in some species such as mice the experiment which had been tested on humans got great success according to felipe sierra s idea we know that the restricted diets experiment really had no distinct effect on rats and mice humans are finding new ways to slowdown the aging process of all the species the experiment is unnecessary to be carried on because of the response of the mice the experiment confirmed that restricted diets extend lifespan in all species many strains of rats and mice do not respond it can be inferred from the underlined sentence that the result of the experiment shows that humans are not pigging out nowadays nowadays humans are turning unhealthy diets into lowercalorie diets how to change humans careless eating habits is long way to go the experiment changed humans increasingly careless eating habits the author most likely wrote this text to compare the two experiments on rats and monkeys illustrate the data from the research call on people to pay attention to their daily diets introduce lively debate to amuse the reader another expert noted that despite some highly publicized studies in certain species the link between restricted eating and longer lifespan has been far from proven another expert noted that that despite far from proven the treadle pump is based on design developed in the s by norwegian engineer gunnar barnes it can be made locally the treadle pump is easy to build from bamboo or other wood and two metal cylinders with pistons the pistons go up and down as person stands on lever devices treadles and uses natural walking motion how many hours day the pump needs to be operated depends on the season and how much water is needed for crops it could be two hours day it could be seven hours day small children sometimes stand with their parents on the treadles everyone in the family can take turns operating the pump the acumen fund is nonprofit group that invests in business projects to fight poverty it studied the effects of treadle pumps in the indian state of uttar pradesh uttar pradesh has three treadle pump manufacturers and more than seventythree thousand pumps acumen reported that families using them ate more vegetables because they were able to grow more to eat and to sell many of these families also drank more milk because they bought cow with their added earnings men with treadle pumps often no longer have to leave the farm to seek extra work in cities the pump can also improve education farmers often use their extra earnings to buy books for their children or to pay for schooling farmer in zambia said he hoped to have enough money in three years to buy dieselpowered pump then he could grow more crops over larger area but the world economic crisis has had an effect on some farmers ide executive director zenia tata says some who were able to buy diesel pumps now do not have enough money to buy fuel so they are using their treadle pumps again the treadle pump is invented by an american engineer is mainly made of metal consists of two cylinders with pistons consists of two cylinders with an engine what does the author want to tell us about the treadle pump in the second paragraph its history its working principle its structure its usage and effects it can be inferred from the passage that it is easy to learn how to operate the treadle pump it is difficult to build treadle pump the treadle pump is used more in winter than in summer operating the treadle pump can keep fit each treadle pump manufacturer in the indian state of uttar pradesh has produced on average about pumps pumps pumps pumps why does the farmer in zambia hope to buy dieselpowered pump because he wants to grow crops on larger scale because he hates to leave the farm to seek fortune in cities because dieselpowered pump is cheaper than before because oil is much cheaper than before ide executive director zenia tata says some who were able to buy diesel pumps now do not have enough money to buy fuel ide executive director zenia tata says that some do not have enoueh money to buy fuel who were able to buy diesel pumps some it was near dusk and kim cooper and her husband steve were trucking through northern kentucky transportation auto parts from louisville to detroit for goods company steve wake up she shouted there s truck on fire inside the burning truck ronnie sanders was fighting for his life he been running heavy load of tractors and forklifts from georgia to indianapolis when van in front of him stopped suddenly in traffic on the icy road as ronnie bore down he could see children in the backseat the truck s bulk would probably protect him from the worst of the impact but the force of tons would likely crush everyone inside the van i figured instead of killing other people i just put the truck in the ditch at the bottom rocks cut fuel tank which caught fire tree branch destroyed the windshield and knocked ronnie unconscious he came to life couple of minutes later to find the cabin flames and his legs on fire steve dashed to ronnie who was hanging headfirst from the passenger door ronnie had used his pocketknife to cut himself free from the driver sside seat belt only to get his boot trapped in another one steve climbed into the burning cab to free him he tried three times to pull ronnie out before finally freeing him but ronnie s legs were still burning so steve laid him on the ground ripped off his own shirt and beat the flames with it he managed to drag him about yards when one of the truck s gallon fuel tanks exploded both steve and ronnie paid price for risking their lives for strangers ronnie spent two months in the hospital and received skin grafts on both of his legs steve suffered smoke breathing and minor burns and shrapnel from the fuel tank explosion broke tooth in february the coopers received hero of the highway award from the open road foundation for rescuing an injured driver steve insists ronnie is the real hero if he hadn t gone into the ditch he would have hit that van it was his decision to drive off the road i feel pretty good about it says ronnie lot of people could have been hurt the coopers ronnie ronnie steve ronnie according to the passage ronnie s putting the truck in the ditch contributes to his concern for his own safety his poor driving skill the icy road his concern for others lives i figured instead of killing other people i just put the truck in the ditch what probably made ronnie come to life after driving the truck in the ditch the noise from the highway the call from the coopers the pain from the burning legs the heat of the fire he came to life couple of minutes later to find the cab in flames and his legs on fire how did steve put out the flames in ronnie s legs he beat the flames with ronnie s shirt he beat the flames with his own shirt he put out the fire with tank of water he put out the fire with bag of sand steve ronnie what does the underlined word shrapnel in paragraph mean branch of tree small piece of metal wave of the explosion the heat of the explosion shrapnel from the fuel tank explosion broke tooth which of the following can be the best title of this passage heroes the coopers heroes roadside flames accidents on the icy road accidents in the ditch astronauts aboard the space station celebrated space first on wednesday by drinking water that had been recycled from their urine and sweat and water that condenses from exhaled air they said cheers clicked drinking bags and toasted nasa workers on the ground who were sipping their own version of recycled drinking water the recycling system is needed for astronaut stations on the moon and mars it also will save nasa money because it won t have to ship up as much water to the station by space shuttle or cargo rockets besides it s important as the space station is about to expand from three people living on board to six the recycling system had been brought up to the space station last november by space shuttle endeavour but it couldn t be used until samples were tested back on earth so when it came time to actually drink up nasa made big deal of it the threeman crew stood holding their drinks and congratulated engineers in two nasa centers that worked on the system this is something that had been the stuff of science fiction barratt said before taking small mouthful the taste is worth trying nasa deputy space shuttle manager leroy cain called it huge milestone the new system takes the combined urine of the crew from the toilet moves it to big tank where the water is boiled off and the vapor is collected the rest of the urine is thrown away the water vapor is mixed with water from air condensation and then it goes through filters when six crew members are aboard it can make about six gallons from urine in about six hours some people may find the idea of drinking recycled urine distasteful but it is also done on earth with lot longer time between urine and the tap said marybeth edeen the space station s national lab manager the technology nasa developed for this system has already been used for quick water purification after the asian tsunami edeen said we are happy to have this water work through the system we re happy to have it work through our systems barratt said according to the text the recycling system is important because it makes traveling to the moon for the common person possible with it nasa won t need to ship any water up to the space station it can help to meet the need for more water after the crew are expanded it protects the environment in space by reducing the amount of waste it s important as the space station is about to expand from three people living on board to six what is the right time order of the following events the samples of the recycled water were tested on earth astronauts celebrated the space first of making water from urine the recycling system was brought up to the space station the technology for the system was used to quickly purify water the technology nasa developed for this system has already been used for quick water purification after the asian tsunami the recycling system had been brought up to the space station last november couldn t be used until samples were tested back on earth from para we can know the theory behind the recycling system the effect of the recycling system the process of the recycling system an opinion on the recycling system what did edeen say about recycled urine and the recycling system the taste of recycled urine is not as good as common water the recycling system has made science fiction story come true the idea of drinking recycled urine makes astronauts feel unpleasant it takes longer time on earth to make water from urine than in space with lot onger time between urine and the tap what is the best title for the passage the research of nasa has made great progress new technology is used in the space station drink up space station recycles urine to water good news water recycled from urine tastes good drink up space station recycles urine to watert

elizabeth is preparing to have her swans counted buckingham palace has announced that the annual swan upping tradition dating back to the th century which involves census of the swan population on the river thames will be conducted by the queen s official swan marker from july with the assistance of the queen s swan warden professor christopher perrins of the university of oxford the swans and young cygnets are also assessed for any signs of injury or disease buckingham palace said in announcing the count the process involves the swan marker david barber rowing up the thames for five days with the swan warden in traditional skiffs while wearing special scarlet uniforms and counting weighing and measuring swans and cygnets it may seem eccentric but it is very important to the queen according to custom britain s sovereign owns all unmarked mute swans in open water but the queen now exercises the right only on stretches of the thames and its nearby tributaries in medieval times the swan marker would not only travel up the river counting the swans but would catch as many as possible as they were soughtafter for banquets and feasts this year the swan marker and the swan warden are particularly keen to discover how much damage is being caused to swans and cygnets by attacks from dogs and from discarded fishing tackle it is also an important year because queen elizabeth has decided to join her team of swan uppers for part of the census she will follow them up the river and visit local school project on the whole subject of swans cygnets and the thames education and conservation are essential to the role of swan upping and the involvement of school children is always rewarding experience buckingham palace said in medieval times swans were better protected than now lot of swans were killed by dogs swans were delicious dish on royal banquets common people could catch the swans we can infer from the passage that the process of counting the swans remains almost unchanged in the past years involves lot of royal members sometimes lasts longer than before is always guarded by special soldiers this year the swan marker and the swan warden mainly want to find out the exact number of swans and cygnets how local school project is going on how much damage the swans and cygnets suffer how education and conservation are carried out along the thames which of the following is the main idea of the passage britain s queen is concerned about swans britain s queen orders count of swans an old tradition in buckingham palace queen elizabeth will count swans herself the underlined word tributaries can be best replaced by districts banks trees branches in medieval times the swan marker would not only travel up the river counting the swans but would catch as many as possible as they were soughtafter for banquets and feasts not only but also as happiness is contagious researchers reported on thursday people with the most social connections spouses friends neighbors and relatives were also the happiest the data showed each additional happy person makes you happier christakis said imagine that i am connected to you and you are connected to others and others are connected to still others it is this fabric of humanity like an american patch quilt each person sits on differentcolored patch imagine that these patches are happy and unhappy patches your happiness depends on what is going on in the patch around you christakis said it is not just happy people connecting with happy people which they do above and beyond there is this contagious process going on and happiness is more contagious than unhappiness they discovered if social contact is happy it increases the likelihood that you are happy by percent fowler said friend of friend or the friend of spouse or sibling if they are happy increases your chances by percent he added happy thirddegree friend the friend of friend of friend increases person s chances of being happy by percent but every extra unhappy friend increases the likelihood that you ll be unhappy by percent fowler said the finding is interesting and it is useful too fowler said among other benefits happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced mortality pain reduction and improved cardiac function so better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to promote healthier society he said the study also fits in with other data suggested in that having extra increased person s chances of becoming happier by about percent happy friend is worth about christakis said according to the research your happiness has nothing to do with your workmates or schoolmates has something to do with anyone who has close relationship with you depends on those who are in favour of you or are against you has little to do with what social connections you have the underlined word contagious in the first paragraph means infectious beautiful effective prior contagious it can be inferred that happiness spreads as fast and widely as unhappiness unhappiness spreads faster and more widely than happiness happiness spreads faster and more widely than unhappiness the spread of unhappiness has not been studied by researchers and happiness is more contagious than unhappiness they discovered which of the following will increase your chances of becoming happier most being in party with happy atmosphere happy experience of your brother or your parents happy trip to foreign country of your friends happiness of your friend s friend if social contact is happy what does christakis mean by saying happy friend is worth about happy friend can help you bring in wealth of happy friend is wealth which is worth about happy friend increases your chances of being happy by happy friend increases your chances of being happy by that having extra increased person s chances of becoming happier by about percent the study also fits in with other data suggested in that having extra increased person s chances of becoming happier by about percent the study also fits in with other data suggested in data that data having extra person s chances of becoming happier chances by about percent the parthenon in athens is building with long and complex history built nearly years ago as temple celebrating the greek goddess athena it was for thousands of years the church of the virgin mary of the athenians then mosque and finally ruin the building was changed and the sculptures much damaged over the centuries by only about half of the original sculptural decoration remained between and lord elgin the british ambassador to the ottoman empire which controlled athens acting with the full knowledge and permission of the ottoman authorities removed about half of the remaining sculptures from the fallen ruins and from the building itself lord elgin loved greek history and transported the sculptures back to britain the arrival of the sculptures in london had huge effect on the european public greatly increasing interest in ancient greek culture and influencing contemporary artistic trends these sculptures were acquired from lord elgin by the british museum in and since then they have all been on display to the public free of charge since the early s however the greek government has argued for the permanent removal to athens of all the parthenon sculptures in the british museum they have also challenged the british museum board of trustees legal title to the sculptures the british museum however insists that it exists to tell the story of cultural achievement throughout the world from the dawn of human history over two million years ago until the present day the museum considers itself an important resource for the world the breadth and depth of its collection allows the world public to reexamine cultural identities and explore the complex network of interconnected world cultures it also says that within the context of this unparalleled collection the parthenon sculptures are an important representation of ancient athenian civilization each year millions of visitors admire the artistry of the sculptures and gain insights on how ancient greece influenced and was influenced by the other civilizations that it encountered for most of its history people went to the parthenon to admire the goddess athena pray to their god search for sculptures learn about its complex history the underlined it in paragraph refers to the british museum the greek government the parthenon the british museum board of trustees what can we infer from the passage the sculptures introduced ancient greek culture to the west ancient greek culture has greatly influenced world culture the british museum has made much money from the parthenon sculptures the british museum is the place most capable of preserving these sculptures what can we learn about lord elgin from the passage he is greatly admired in greece he worked for the ottoman empire he saved the parthenon sculptures from being destroyed he had deep interest in greek culture the author s main intention in writing this passage is to tell the history of the parthenon and its sculptures what people can see in the british museum why the british museum refuses to return the sculptures the influence of greece on british culture if you travel to new exhibit at the san francisco conservatory of flowers you will have chances to see some meat eating plants take bladderworts kind of such plant for example they appear so small and grow in quiet pond but these are the fastest known killers of the plant kingdom able to capture small insect in of second using trap door once the trap door closes on the victim the enzymes similar to those in the human stomach slowly digest the insect when dinner is over the plant opens the trap door and is ready to trap again meat eating plants grow mostly in wet areas with soil that doesn t offer much food value in such conditions these amazing plants have developed insect traps to get their nutritional needs over thousands of years north america has more such plants than any other continent generally speaking the traps may have attractive appearance to fool the eye like pitcher plants which get their name because they look like beautiful pitchers container like bottle full of nectar the asian pitcher plant for example has bright colors and an attractive half closed lid curious insects are tempted to come close and take sip and then slide down the slippery slope to their deaths hair like growths along the pitcher walls ensure that nothing cab escape and the digestive enzymes can get to work tiny insect can be digested in few hours but fly takes couple of days some of these pitchers are large enough to hold two gallons meateating plants only eat people in science fiction movies but sometimes bird or other small animals will discover that pitcher plant isn t good place to get drink from the first paragraph we can know that bladderworts can capture small insects in second capture an insect in the shortest time be found floating on quiet lake digest an insect in of second bladderworts if the trap door of meateating plant is closed the plant is fooling insects into taking sip is producing nectar is tempting insects to come close is enjoying dinner meateating plants can grow in wet and poor soil because they can get nutrition from animals don t need much food value can make the most of such conditions have developed digestive enzymes which of the following is the picture of the asian pitcher plant according to the passage which of the following is true south asia has the most meateating plants some of the meateating plants can even eat human hairlike growths in the plants help trap insects the traps of these plants have dull color after years of research and testing the hybrid car was developed and put on the market it s an interesting and exciting new improvement in today s world as we look for better ways to protect the quality of the air we breathe and conserve our natural resources the quality of our air is affected by many different things but one of the largest sources of air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline which is used to power car s engine the epa has set national standards to help control the level of harmful pollutants sent off into the air and the automobile industry has acted by producing hybrid car that uses less gas and therefore causes less pollution hybrid car is combination of regular car that runs on gasoline and an electric car that is battery powered some people tend to think that since the hybrid car is partially electric you have to plug it in to charge it but that s not how it works the volt battery pack is actually recharged through the energy that is produced when the car s brakes are used this is referred to as regenerative braking because it generates electricity although the hybrid car still runs on gasoline most of the time this helps it use less gas than regular car when the driver stops at traffic light the engine automatically shuts off to save fuel then as soon as the driver puts the car in gear and touches the gas pedal the engine starts back up have you ever ridden in car with someone who ran out of gas that probably wouldn t happen if you were riding in hybrid car it flashes waming on its computer screen that says i am low on gas when it completely runs out the warning reads you are now out of gas then the electric power supply kicks in to let the driver travel few more miles to gas station hybrid cars which of the following is true according to the passage the hybrid car will be put on the market hybrid cars run faster than regular cars when the hybrid car stops at traffic light the driver will get warning the burning of fossil fuels is one of the largest sources of air pollution but one of the largest sources of air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline which is used to power car s engine according to the passage the word hybrid refers to hightech discovery energy saving new invention combination of two things hybrid car is combination of regular car that runs on gasoline and an electric car that is battery powered regenerative breaking is an important process of the hybrid car because it allows the car to come to quick stop it gives the driver smoother ride it produces energy to charge the battery it can control the speed of the car the volt battery pack is because it generates electricity which of the following is right about the epa they designed hybrid cars they outlawed the burning of fossil fuels they set important guidelines that help control pollution their main purpose is to protect endangered plants and animals which of the following is the reason for developing hybrid cars they use less gas than regular cars they re safer to drive than most cars they re more modern than other cars they cost less than regular cars although the hybrid car still runs on gasoline most of the time this helps it use less gas than regular car bananas are one of the world s most important food crops they are also one of the most valuable exports bananas do not grow from seeds instead they grow from existing plants bananas are threatened by disease because all the plants on farm are copies of each other they all share the same genetic weaknesses for example the cavendish banana is most popular in north american and european markets however some kinds of fungus organisms easily infect the cavendish black sigatoka disease affects the leaves of cavendish banana plants the disease is controlled on large farms by putting chemicals on the plant s leaves farmers put anti fungal chemicals on their crops up to once week another fungal disease is more serious panama disease attacks the roots of the banana plant there is no chemical treatment for this disease infected plants must be destroyed panama disease has affected crops in southeast asia australia and south africa there is concern that it may spread to bananas grown in the americas this could threaten an important export product for central and south america the international network for the improvement of banana and plantain supports research on bananas the group has headquarters in france and other offices in the major banana growing areas of the world the group says that more research must be done to develop improved kinds of bananas the group says that fungal diseases mainly affect only one kind of banana in fact there are five hundred different kinds of bananas food and agriculture organization of the united nations has said that the cavendish banana represents only of world production the u n agency says farmers should grow different kinds of bananas this protects against diseases that affect only one kind experts warn that disease may cause the cavendish banana to disappear this happened earlier to another popular banana because of its genetic weakness against disease cavendish what does this passage mainly tell us bananas are the world s most important food crops the risk to popular banana shows need to grow other kinds there are five hundred different kinds of bananas how to grow bananas in different countries cavendish bananas are threatened by disease because they grow from seeds they are one of the most valuable exports the only way to prevent it is to put chemicals on their leaves they have genetic weaknesses against disease panama disease doesn t belong to fungal disease affects the leaves of banana plants destroys bananas more seriously than black sigatoka disease has spread to bananas all over the world we can infer from paragraph that the center of the group is in the us the cavendish banana covers only small part of the yield of bananas the key to solving the disease is to research all kinds of bananas each fungal disease affects five hundred different kinds of bananas the group has headquarters in france according to the passage which information is right the cavendish banana can mainly be imported from north america and europe panama disease affects the leaves of cavendish banana plants the cavendish banana won t die out in the future the cavendish banana makes up only one tenth of world production the cavendish banana is most popular in north american and european markets this happened earlier to another popular banana because of its genetic weakness against disease because of this can i see my baby the happy new mother asked when the bundle was in her arms and she moved the fold of cloth to look upon his tiny face she gasped the doctor turned quickly and looked out of the tall hospital window the baby had been born without ears

she sighed knowing that his life was to be misfortunate who gave the son the ears doctor his father his mother stranger the underlined word reveal in the last but one paragraph means see show find search reveal the best title for the passage would be mother s hair an unforgettable memory who gave me the ears who is my best respectable person when he rushed home from school one day and threw himself into his mother s arms she sighed knowing that his life was to be misfortunate when he arms she sighed knowing to be misfortunate when times get tough we all look for ways to cut back when we re hungry we eat at home instead of going out we take buses instead of taxis and we wear our old designer jeans just few months longer with college expenses at all time highs high school students are eager to do anything to cut the cost of university education one cost cutting proposal is to allow college students to get bachelor s degree in three years instead of four educational institutions have been actively exploring ways to make the learning process more efficient but there s question would the quality of undergraduate education suffer few us universities have formally approved three year degree model i doubt that mainstream north american colleges will carry out three year curriculum any time soon for one thing most universities already allow highly qualified students to graduate early by testing out of certain classes and obtaining number of college credits in addition at famous universities the committee who determine which courses are required and which courses are electives are unlikely to suddenly throw out one quarter of the required credits professors will resist diluting the quality of the education they offer in my opinion quality four year education is always superior to quality three year education college education requires sufficient time for student to become skilled in their major and do coursework in fields outside their major it is not good idea to water down education any more than it s not good idea to water down medicine if we want to help students find their way through university we should help them understand early on what knowledge and skills they need to have upon graduation we should allow students to test out of as many courses as possible we should give them chance to earn money as interns in meaningful part time jobs that relate to their university studies such as the five year co op program at northeastern university which of the following can be the best title it s time to shorten the learning process best learning takes place over time university education should be watered down college education calls for reform we can learn from the passage that most american universities are against the three year degree model many famous us universities are considering adopting the three year degree model professors are willing to accept the three year degree model the three year degree model can make college learning more efficient few us universities have formally approved three year degree model in most us universities college students are offered the co op program electives credits make up one quarter of the required credits all students are required to finish four year education before graduation some excellent students can graduate ahead of time most universities already allow highly qualified students to graduate early we can infer that the author is college professor the author thinks the cost of university education is too high for people to afford the author considers the university education quality very important the author pays special attention to the all round development of college students college education requires sufficient time for student to become skilled in their major it is not good idea to water down education the first paragraph serves as n explanation definition introduction comment i once had my chinese mba students brainstorming on two hour business plans i separated them into six groups and gave them an example restaurant chain the more original their idea the better i said finally five of the six groups presented plans for restaurant chains the sixth proposed catering service though i admitted the time limit had been difficult i expressed my disappointment my students were middle managers financial analysts and financiers from state owned enterprises and global companies they were not without talent or opinions but they had been shaped by an educational system that rarely stressed or rewarded critical thinking or inventiveness the scene i just described came in different forms during my two years teaching at the school papers were often copied from the web and the harvard business review case study debates were written up and just memorized students frequently said that copying is superior business strategy better than inventing and creating in china every product you can imagine has been made and sold but so few well developed marketing and management minds have been raised that it will be long time before most people in the world can name chinese brand with this problem in mind partnerships with institutions like yale and mit have been established and then there s the thousand talent scheme this new government program is intended to improve technological modernization by attracting top foreign trained scientists to the mainland with big money but there are worries about china s research environment it s hardly known for producing independent thinking and openness and even big salary offers may not be attractive enough to overcome this at last for china becoming major world creator is not just about setting up partnerships with top western universities nor is it about gathering group of well educated people and telling them to think creatively it s about establishing rich learning environment for young minds it s not that simple why does the author feel disappointed at his students because there is one group presenting catering service because the six groups made projects for restaurant chains because all the students copied case for the difficult topic because the students ideas were lacking in creativeness which of the following scenes is not considered as lack of creation papers were often downloaded from the internet students often said that copying is preferable business strategy students combine knowledge and critical thoughts to solve problem case study debates were written up as well as recited the underlined word scheme in the forth paragraph means timetable theme project policy this new government program this thousand talent scheme scheme program project program we can infer from the passage that china can make and sell any product all over the world high pay may not solve the problem of china s research environment cooperation with institutions has been set up to make chinese brand the new government program are aimed at encouraging imagination even big salary offers may not be attractive enough to overcome this this china s learning environment problem it s hardly known for producing independent thinking and openness which is the best title of the passage look for new way of learning reward creative thinking how to become creator establish technical environment throughout the world boys and girls prefer to play with different types of toys boys typically like to play with cars and trucks while girls typically choose to play with dolls why is this traditional sociological explanation is that boys and girls are socialized and encouraged to play with different types of toys by their parents peers and the society growing scientific evidence suggests however that boys and girls toy preferences may have biological origin in gerianne m alexander of texas m university and melissa hines of city university in london surprised the scientific world by showing that monkeys showed the same sextypical toy preferences as humans in the study alexander and hines gave two masculine toys ball and police car two feminine toys soft doll and cooking pot and two neutral toys picture book and stuffed dog to male and female monkeys they then assessed the monkeys preference for each toy by measuring how much time they spent with each their data showed that male monkeys showed significantly greater interest in the masculine toys and the female monkeys showed significantly greater interest in the feminine toys the two sexes did not differ in their preference for the neutral toys if children s toy preferences were largely formed by gender socialization as traditional sociologists claim in which their parents give genderappropriate toys to boys and girls how can these male and female monkeys have the same preferences as boys and girls they were never socialized by humans and they had never seen these toys before in their lives traditional sociologists believe boys and girls toy preferences are passed down from their parents have biological origin have nothing to do with gender socialization are largely formed in later life the study by alexander and hines shows that monkeys also play toys as humans do also have sextypical toy preference have no toy preferences like to play different toys at different time alexander and hines carried out the study to find out why boys and girls prefer different toys test the intelligence of monkeys test whether monkeys like to play toys find more evidence for traditional sociology according to the study if given stuffed dog only the male monkeys showed interest the female monkeys showed more interest the male and female monkeys showed the same interest neither the male nor the female monkeys showed any interest masculine toys are mainly intended for monkeys adult boys girls when steve maxwell graduated from college he had an engineering degree and hightech job but he couldn t balance his checkbook i took one finance class in college but dropped it to go on ski trip says the yearold father of three who lives in windsor colorado i actually had to go to my bank and ask them to teach me how to read my statement one of the biggest obstacles to making money is not understanding it thousands of us avoid investing because we just don t get it but to make money you must be financially literate it bothered me that i didn t understand this stuff says steve so i read books and magazines about money management and investing and i asked every financial whiz i knew to explain things to me he and his wife started applying the lessons they made point to live below their means they never bought on impulse always negotiated better deals on their cars cable bills furniture and stayed in their home long after they went for an expensive vacation they also put percent of their annual salary into investments within ten years they were millionaires and people were coming to steve for advice someone would say i need to refinance my house what should i do lot of times i wouldn t know the answer but i go to find it and learn something in the process he says in steve quit his job to become part owner of company that holds personal finance seminars for employees of corporations like walmart he also started going to real estate investment seminars and it s paid off he now owns million worth of investment properties including apartment complexes shopping mall and quarry i was an engineer who never thought this life was possible but all it truly takes is little selfeducation says steve you can do anything once you understand the basics when steve maxwell graduated from college he couldn t balance his work and life made up his mind to become millionaire didn t know how to manage his money often went to banks to borrow money he couldn t balance his checkbook i actually had to go to my bank and ask them to teach me how to read my statement steve maxwell the underlined part live below their means in paragraph probably means take effective measures live miserable life spend more money than they had spend less money than they had since steve maxwell became millionaire he has been unwilling to help others hasn t stopped learning from practice has been willing to follow others advice has stopped to invest in houses lot of times i wouldn t know the answer but i go find it and learn something in the process what would be the best title for the passage selfmade engineer how to balance your checkbook don t avoid investing educate yourself to become millionaire selfeducation it can be inferred from the passage that selfeducation is very important to one s life everyone should learn how to invest in their life steve maxwell was quite interested in finance classes in college steve became rich because he saved every penny he had earned steve steve lisa was running late lisa had lot to do at work plus visitors on the way her parents were coming in for thanksgiving from her hometown but as she hurried down the subway stairs she started to feel uncomfortably warm by the time she got to the platform lisa felt weak and tired maybe it hadn t been good idea to give blood the night before she thought she rested herself against post close to the tracks several yards away frank and his girlfriend jennifer found spot close to where the front of the train would stop they were deep in discussion about house they were thinking of buying but when he heard the scream followed by someone yelling oh my god she fell in frank didn t hesitate he jumped down to the tracks and ran some feet

train was about seconds from the station it was hard to lift her she was just out but he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge that was where lisa briefly regained consciousness felt herself being pulled along the ground and saw someone else holding her purse lisa thought she been robbed woman held her hand and man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head and she tried to talk but she couldn t and that was when she realized how much pain she was in police and fire officials soon

reaction at the time i saw the train coming and i was thinking he was going to die she explained frank lisa what was the most probable cause for lisa s weakness she had run long way she felt hot in the subway she had done lot of work she had donated blood the night before it hadn t been good idea to give blood lisa why did jennifer try to stop her boyfriend because they would miss their train because he didn t see the train coming because she was sure lisa was hard to lift because she was afraid the train would kill him i was thinking he was going to die frank frank how did frank save lisa by lifting her to the platform by helping her rise to her feet by pulling her along the ground by dragging her away from the edge he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform frank lisa when did lisa become conscious again when the train was leaving after she was back on the platform after the police and fire officials came when man was cleaning the blood from her head felt herself being

computer programmer david jones earns year designing new computer games yet he cannot find bank ready to let him have credit card instead he has been told to wait another two years until he is the yearold works for small firm in liverpool where the problem of most young people of his age is finding job david s firm releases two new games for the fast growing computer market each month but david s biggest headache is what to do with his money even though he earns lot he cannot drive car take out mortgage or get credit cars david got his job with the liverpool based company four months ago year after leaving school with six o levels and working for time in computer shop i got the job because the people who run the firm knew i had already written some programs he said david spends some of his money on records and clothes and gives his mother pounds week but most of his spare time is spent working unfortunately computing was not part of our studies at school he said but i had been studying it in books and magazines for four years in my spare time i knew what i wanted to do and never considered staying on at school most people in this business are fairly young anyway david added i would like to earn million and i suppose early retirement is possibility you never know when the market might disappear in what way is david different from people of his age he often goes out with friends he lives with his mother he has handsome income he graduated with six o levels what is one of the problems that david is facing now he is too young to get credit card he has no time to learn driving he has very little spare time he will soon lose his job yet he cannot find bank ready to let him have credit card why was david able to get the job in the company he had done well in all his exams he had written some computer programs he was good at playing computer games he had learnt to use computers at school i got the job because the people who run the firm knew i had already written some programs why did david decide to leave school and start working he received lots of job offers he was eager to help his mother he lost interest in school studies he wanted to earn his own living unfortunately computing was not part of our studies at school i knew what i wanted to do and never considered staying on at school in only six days i lost seven pounds of weight two full inches in the first three days these are the kinds of statements used in magazine newspaper radio and television ads promising new shapes and new looks to those who buy the medicine or the device the promoters of such products say they can shape the legs slim the face smooth wrinkles or in some other way add to beauty or desirability often such products are nothing more than money making things for their promoters the results they produce are questionable and some are dangerous to health to understand how these products can be legally promoted to the public it is necessary to understand something of the laws covering their regulation if the product is drug fda food and drug administration can require proof under the food drug and cosmetic act that it is safe and effective before it is put on the market but if the product is device fda has no authority to require pre marketing proof of safety or effectiveness if product already on the market is danger to health fda can request the producer or distributor to remove it from the market voluntarily or it can take legal action including seizure of the product one notable case few years ago involved an electrical device called the relaxacisor which had been sold for reducing the waistline the relaxacisor produced electrical shocks to the body through contact pads fda took legal action against the distributor to stop the sale of the devices on the grounds that it was dangerous to health and life obviously most of the devices on the market have never been the subject of court proceedings and new devices appear continually before buying it is up to judge the consumer to judge the safety or effectiveness of such items it can be inferred that the ads mentioned in the text are objective costly unreliable illegal which of the following is true according to the text the court is in charge of removing dangerous products new products are more likely to be questionable the production of device must be approved by fda the promoters usually just care about profits fda can ask for the proof of safety and effectiveness of product if it is drug if it is device if its consumers make complaints if its distributors challenge fda s authority the relaxacisor is mentioned as product which was designed to produce electricity product whose distributor was involved in legal case successful advertisement of beauty product an example of quality beauty product relaxacisor the author intends to make consumers aware of the promoters false promises show the weakness of the law on product safety give advice on how to keep young and beautiful introduce the organization of fda transport guide the brisbane city council bcc is responsible for bus and ferry services within the city limits and suburbs most buses will either arrive at the city or an interchange where connecting buses can be caught bcc buses operate from am to pm monday to thursday and am to am on fridays on weekends and public holidays buses operate less frequently pre paid bus tickets can be purchased from the qut queensland university of technology bookshop the campus news agency most other news agencies and general stores and any bcc customer service center short term students at qut cannot use their id cards to gain discount fare on bcc public transport you will need to buy an adult ticket to travel bus fares are dependent on the number of zones you have to travel there are several types of tickets zone cost aud single daily off peak daily ten trip saver weekly monthly single one way ticket to reach your destination including transfers within hours daily unlimited travel within the zones off peak daily discounted unlimited travel between am and pm and after pm monday to friday and all day on weekends and public holidays weekly unlimited travel within the zones for one week from the date of issue monthly unlimited travel within the zones for one calendar month from the date of issue ten trip saver trips at any time within the zones on buses and ferries only transport routes timetables and fare information are available from public transport information centre ann street corner of george st brisbane city phone transport information service the transport guide above is most likely provided by public transport information centre the brishane city council queensland university of technology bcc customer service centres queensland university of technology we can learn from the passage that buses are scheduled as usual on weekends and public holidays regular students at qut need to buy adult tickets prepaid tickets can be bought from the public transport information centre ten trip savers can be used at off peak time ten trip saver trips at any time within the zones on buses and ferries only ten trip savers an exchange

who skip breakfast and they have ton of different excuses for doing it some say they don t have time others think they re saving calories still others just don t like breakfast food but the bottom line is that eating in the morning is very important when you re trying to lose weight eating just about anything from to calories would be better than nothing at all says katherine brooking r who developed the super easy eating plan for this year s self challenge and even pizza can be healthy if it s loaded with vegetables and you stick to one small piece breakfast is one meal i never miss and the same goes for most weight loss success stories research shows that eating breakfast keeps you from overeating later in the day researchers at the university of southern california found that breakfast skippers have bigger chance of gaining weight than those who regularly have morning meal so eat something in the morning anything i know plenty of friends who end up having no breakfast altogether and have just coffee or orange juice i say try heating up last night s leftovers it may sound crazy but if it works for you do it i find if i tell myself you can always eat it tomorrow i put away the leftovers instead of eating more that night try it you may save yourself some pre bed time calories and watch your body gain the fat burning effects the word leftovers in paragraph probably means food remaining after meal things left undone meals made of vegetables pizza topped with fruit last night leftovers what can we infer from the text working women usually have breakfast in hurry many people have wrong ideas about breakfast there are some easy ways of cooking meal eating vegetables helps save energy but according to the last paragraph it is important to eat something for breakfast be careful about what you eat heat up food before eating it eat calorie controlled food the text is written mainly for those who go to work early who want to lose weight who stay up late who eat before sleep when i was seven my father gave me timex ray first watch i loved it wore it for years and haven t had another one since it stopped ticking decade ago why because i don t need one i have mobile phone and i m always near someone with an ipod or something like that all these devices tell the time which is why if you look around you ll see lots of empty wrists sales of watches to young adults have been going down since but while the wise have realized that they don t need them others apparently including some distinguished men of our time are spending total fortunes on them brands such as rolex patek philippe and breitling command shocking prices up to for piece this is ridiculous expensive cars go faster than cheap cars expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes but these days all watches tell the time as well as all other watches expensive watches come with extra functions but who needs them how often do you dive to metres into the sea or need to find your direction in the area around the south pole so why pay that much of five years school fees for watches that allow you to do these things if justice were done the swiss watch industry should have closed down when the japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for five pound note instead the swiss reinvented the watch with the aid of millions of pounds worth of advertising as message about the man wearing it rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains patek philippe is for one from rich or noble family breitling suggests you like to pilot planes across the world watches are now classified as investments patek philippe recently sold for nearly while s rolexes have gone from to plus in year but watch is not an investment it s toy for self satisfaction matter of fashion prices may keep going up they ve been rising for years but when fashion moves on the owner of that beauty will suddenly find his pride and joy is no more good investment than my childhood timex the sales of watches to young people have fallen because they have other devices to tell the time think watches too expensive prefer to wear an ipod have no sense of time i have mobile phone and i m always near someone with an ipod or something like that all these devices tell the time it seems ridiculous to the writer that people dive metres into the sea expensive clothes sell better than cheap ones cheap cars don t run as fast as expensive ones expensive watches with unnecessary functions still sell expensive watches come with extra functions so why pay that much of five years school fees for watches that allow you to do these things instead the swiss reinvented the watch with the aid of millions of pounds worth of advertising as message about the man wearing it what can be learnt about swiss watch industry from the passage it targets rich people as its potential customers it s hard for the industry to beat its competitors it wastes huge amount of money in advertising it s easy for the industry to reinvent cheap watches rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains patek philippe is for one from rich or noble family breitling suggest you like to pilot planes across the world which would be the best title for the passage timex or rolex my childhood timex watches not for me watches valuable collection all too often choice that seems sustainable turns out on closer examination to be problematic probably the best example is the rush to produce ethanol for fuel from corn corn is renewable resource you can harvest it and grow more almost limitlessly so replacing gas with corn ethanol seems like great idea one might get bit more energy out of the ethanol than that used to make it which could still make ethanol more sustainable than gas generally but that s not the end of the problem using corn to make ethanol means less corn is left to feed animals and people which drives up the cost of food that result leads to turning the fallow land including in some cases rain forest in places such as brazil into farmland which in turn gives off lots of carbon dioxide co into the air finally over many years the energy benefit from burning ethanol would make up for the forest loss but by then climate change would have progressed so far that it might not help you cannot really declare any practice sustainable until you have done complete life cycle analysis of its environmental costs even then technology and public policy keep developing and that development can lead to unforeseen and undesired results the admirable goal of living sustainably requires plenty of thought on an ongoing basis what might directly cause the loss of the forest according to the text the growing demand for energy to make ethanol the increasing carbon dioxide in the air the greater need for farmland the big change in weather including in some cases rain forest in places such as brazil into farmland the underlined word it in the second paragraph refers to the energy benefit the forest loss climate change burning ethanol the energy benefit from burning ethanol would make up for the forest loss the energy benefit it the author thinks that replacing gas with corn ethanol is impractical acceptable admirable useless impractical acceptable admirable useless the admirable goal of living sustainable requires plenty of thought on an ongoing basis what does the author mainly discuss in the text technology sustainability ethanol energy environmental protection technology sustainability ethanol energy environmental protection i suddenly heard an elephant crying as though frightened looking down i immediately recognized that something was wrong and ran down to the edge of the near bank there i saw ma shwe with her three month old calf struggling in the fast rising water and it was life and death struggle her calf was floating and screaming with fear ma shwe was as near to the far bank as she could get holding her whole body against the rushing water and keeping the calf pressed against her huge body every now and then the rushing water would sweep the calf away there was sudden rise in the water and the calf was washed clean over the mother s body and was gone ma shwe turned quickly to reach it and pressed the calf with her head and trunk against the rocky bank then with huge effort she picked it up in her trunk and tried until she was able to place it on narrow shelf of rock just at this moment she fell back into the river if she were carried down it would be certain death i knew as well as she did that there was one spot where she could get up the bank but it was on the other side from where she had put her calf while i was wondering what i could do next i heard the sound of mother s love ma shwe had crossed the river and got up the bank and was making her way back as fast as she could roaring all the time but to her calf it was music the moment the author got down to the river bank he saw the calf was about to fall into the river ma shwe was placing the calf on the rock the calf was washed away by the rising water ma shwe was holding the calf against the rushing water there i saw ma shwe with her three month old calf struggling in the fast rising water how did ma shwe manage to save her calf from the fast flowing water by putting it on safe spot by pressing it against her body by taking it away with her by carrying it on her back then with huge effort she picked it up in her trunk and tried until she was able to place it on narrow shelf of rock how did the calf feel about the mother elephant s roaring it was great comfort it was sign of danger it was call for help it was musical note roaring all the time but to her calf it was music what can be the best title for the text mother s love brave act deadly river matter of life and death while i was wondering what i could do next i heard the sound of mother s love few years ago i had an aha moment regarding handwriting i had in my hand sheet of paper with handwritten instructions on it for some sort of editorial task it occurred at first that i did not recognize the handwriting and then i realized whose it must be i finally became aware of the fact that i had been working with this colleague for at least year maybe two and yet i did not recognize her handwriting at that point it was very important event in the computerization of life sign that the informal friendly communication of people working together in an office had changed from notes in pen to instant messages and emails there was time when our workdays were filled with little letters and we recognized one another s handwriting the way we knew voices or faces as child visiting my father s office i was pleased to recognize in little notes on the desks of his staff the same handwriting i would see at home in the notes he would leave on the fridge except that those notes were signed dad instead of rfw all this has been on my mind because of the talk about the rise and fall of handwriting book by florey she shows in her book deep concern about the fall of handwriting and the failure of schools to teach children to write well but many others argue that people in digital age can t be expected to learn to hold pen i don t buy it i don t want to see anyone cut off from the expressive personal associations that pen still promotes better than digital keyboard does for many biographer part of really getting to know their subjects is learning to read their handwriting what some people advocate is teaching one of the many attractive handwritings based on the handwriting of thcentury italy that may sound impossibly grand as if they want kids to learn to draw by copying classical paintings however they have worked in many school systems why was the author surprised at not recognizing his colleague s handwriting he had worked with his colleague long enough his colleague s handwriting was so beautiful his colleague s handwriting was so terrible he still had lot of work to do i had been working with this colleague for at least year people working together in an office used to talk more about handwriting take more notes on workdays know better one another s handwriting communicate better with one another there was time we recognized one another s handwriting the way we knew voices and faces the author s father wrote notes in pen to both his family and his staff to his family in small letters to his family on the fridge to his staff on the desk the same handwriting i would see according to the author handwritten notes are harder to teach in schools attract more attention are used only between friends carry more message for many biographer part of really getting to know their subjects is learning to read their handwriting we can learn from the passage that the author thinks it impossible to teach handwriting does not want to lose handwriting puts the blame on the computer does not agree with florey i don t buy it i don t want to see anyone cut off from personal association that pen still promotes better when people hear president speak they seldom think about others helping to shape the presentation today however presidents depend on writers such as j terry edmonds to help them communicate effectively edmonds is the first african american ever to work as full time speechwriter for u s president he is also the first african american to serve as director of speechwriting for the white house his is an all american story of success edmonds grew up in

secretary for congressman speechwriter for president clinton news secretary in the white house speechwriter for secretary donna shalala he joined the world of politics as news secretary for his congressman from baltimore the text is most likely to be found in book about popular science historical events successful people political systems edmonds outside her shabby cottage old mrs tailor was hanging out laundry on wire line unaware that some children lay hidden in the leaves of nearby tree watching her every move they were determined to find out if she really was witch they watched as she took broomstick to clean the dirt from her stone steps but much to their disappointment she did not mount the broomstick and take flight suddenly the old lady s work was interrupted by the cackling of her hen signal that an egg had been laid in the warm nest on top of the haystack the old broomstick was put aside as she hobbled off towards the haystack followed by sooty black cat she had rescued from fox trap some time back with only three legs it was hard for sooty to keep up with the old lady the cat provided proof the children were sure that only witch would own black cat with three legs there standing on wooden box was mrs tailor stretching out to gather her precious egg taking the egg in one of her hands she began to climb down when without warning the box broke and the old lady

go and get dad amy yelled to her brother tell him about the accident the boys did not need another excuse to leave they ran as fast as they could for help hoping that mrs tailor would not wake and turn the girls into frogs old mrs tailor why were the children hiding in the tree they wanted to watch mrs tailor do her housework closely they were playing hide and seek game they wanted to find out if the rumors about mrs tailor were true they were pretending to be spies they were determined to find out if she really was witch mrs tailor stopped sweeping when her front steps were clean she noticed the children in the tree she was ready to take flight she heard the hen cackling ben did not rush to help mrs tailor because he thought that she could be tricking them he knew that they should not have been in the tree he did not see the old lady fall down he was afraid of the three legged cat ben mrs tailor mrs tailor mrs tailor which of these old sayings best suits the story s lesson for us make hay while the sun shines never judge book by its cover people in glasshouses should not throw stones bird in the hand is worth two in the bush andrew ritchie inventor of the brompton folding bicycle once said that the perfect portable bike would be like magic carpet you could fold it up and put it into your pocket or handbag then he paused but you ll always be limited by the size of the wheels and so far no one has invented folding wheel it was rare indeed unique occasion when i was able to put ritchie right th century inventor william henry james grout did in fact design folding wheel his bike predictably named the grout portable had frame that split into two and larger wheel that could be separated into four pieces all the bits fitted into grout s wonderful bag leather case grout s aim to solve the problems of carrying bike on train now doesn t that sound familiar grout intended to find way of making bike small enough for train travel his bike was huge beast and importantly the design of early bicycles gave him an advantage in grout s day tyres were solid which made the business of splitting wheel into four separate parts relatively simple you couldn t do the same with wheel fitted with one piece inflated tyre so in st century context is the idea of the folding wheel dead it is not british design engineer duncan fitzsimons has developed wheel that can be squashed into something like slender ellipse throughout the tyre remains inflated will the young fitzsimons s folding wheel make it into production i haven t the foggiest idea but his inventiveness shows two things first people have been saying for more than century that bike design has reached its limit except for gradual advances it s as silly concept now as it was years ago there s plenty still to go for second it is in the field of folding bikes that we are seeing the most interesting inventions you can buy folding bike for less than that can be knocked down so small that it can be carried on plane minus wheels of course as hand baggage folding wheels would make all manner of things possible have we yet got the magic carpet of andrew ritchie s imagination no but it s progress we can infer from paragraph that thc brompton folding bike was portable had folding wheel could be put in pocket looked like magic carpet we can learn from the text that the wheels of the grout portable were difficult to separate could be split into pieces were fitted with solid tyres were hard to carry on train and importantly in grout s day tyres were solid we can learn from the text that fitzsimons s invention kept the tyre as whole piece was made into production soon left little room for improvement changed our views on bag design squashed into like slender ellipse which of the following would be the best title for the text three folding bike inventors the making of folding bike progress in folding bike design ways of separating bike wheel we once had poster competition in our fifth grade art class you could win prizes our teacher told us as she wrote the poster information on the blackboard she passed out sheets of construction paper while continuing the first prize is ten dollars you just have to make sure that the words on the blackboard appear somewhere on your poster we studied the board critically some of us looked with one eye and held up certain colors against the blackboard rocking the sheets to the right or left while we conjured up our designs others twisted their hair around their fingers or chewed their erasers while deep in thought we had plans for that ten dollar grand prize each and every one of us i m going to spend mine on candies one hopeful would announce while another practiced looking serious wise and rich everyone in the class made poster some of us used parts of those fancy paper napkins while others used nothing but colored construction paper some of us used big designs and some of us preferred to gather our art tidily down in one corner of our poster and let the space draw the viewer s attention to it some of us would wander past the good students desks and then return to our own projects with growing sense of hopelessness it was yet another grown up trick of the sort they seemed especially fond of making all of us believe we had fair chance and then always always rewarding the same old winners i believe i drew sailboat but i can t say that with any certainty i made it i admired it i determined it to be the very best of all of the posters i had seen and then i turned it in minutes passed no one came along to give me the grand prize and then someone distracted me and i probably never would have thought about that poster again i was still sitting at my desk thinking what poster when the teacher gave me an envelope with ten dollar bill in it and everyone in the class applauded for me what was the teacher s requirement for the poster it must appear in time it must be done in class it must be done on construction sheet it must include the words on the blackboard make sure that the words on the blackboard appear somewhere on your poster the underlined phrase in paragraph most probably means formed an idea for made an outline for made some space for chose some colors for conjure up some while we conjured up our designs others while deep in thought after the teacher s words all the students in the class looked very serious thought they would be rich began to think about their designs began to play games after seeing the good students designs some students loved their own designs more thought they had fair chance put their own designs in corner thought they would not win the prize wander past the good students desks and then return to our own projects with growing sense of hopelessness we can infer from the passage that the author enjoyed grownup tricks very much loved poster competitions very much felt surprised to win the competition became wise and rich after the competition few laws are so effective that you can see results just days after they take effect but in the nine days since the federal cigarette tax more than doubled to per pack smokers have jammed telephone quit lines across the country seeking to kick the habit this is not surprise to public health advocates they ve studied the effect of state tax increases for years finding that smokers especially teens are price sensitive nor is it shock to the industry which fiercely fights every tax increase the only wonder is that so many states insist on closing their ears to the message tobacco taxes improve public health they raise money and most particularly the deter people from taking up the habit as teens which is when nearly all smokers are addicted yet the rate of taxation varies widely in manhattan for instance which has the highest tax in the nation pack of marlboro light kings cost at one drugstore wednesday in charleston s where the centapack tax is the lowest in the nation the price was the influence is obvious in new york high school smoking hit new low in the latest surveys far below the national average by comparison of high school students smoke in kentucky other low tax states have similarly depressing teen smoking records hal rogers representative from kentucky like those who are against high tobacco taxes argues that the burden of the tax falls on low income americans who choose to smoke that s true but there is more reason in keeping future generations of low income workers from getting hooked in the first place as for today s adults if the new tax drives them to quit they will have more to spend on their families cut their risk of cancer and heart disease and feel better the text is mainly about the price of cigarettes the rate of teen smoking the effect of tobacco tax increase the differences in tobacco tax rate what does the author think is surprise teen smokers are price sensitive some states still keep the tobacco tax low tobacco taxes improve public health tobacco industry fiercely fights the tax rise the underlined word deter in paragraph most probably means discourage remove benefit free rogers attitude towards the low income smokers might be that of tolerance unconcern doubt sympathy roger what can we learn from the last paragraph the new tax will be beneficial in the long run low income americans are more likely to fall ill future generations will be hooked on smoking adults will depend more on their families how room designs affect our work and feelings architects have long had the feeling that the places we live in can affect our thoughts feelings and behaviors but now scientists are giving this feeling an empirical basis they are discovering how to design spaces that promote creativity keep people focused and lead to relaxation researches show that aspects of the physical environment can influence creativity in joan meyers levy at the university of minnesota reported that the height of room s ceiling affects how people think her research indicates that higher ceilings encourage people to think more freely which may lead them to make more abstract connections low ceilings on the other hand may inspire more detailed outlook in addition to ceiling height the view afforded by building may influence an occupant s ability to concentrate nancy wells and her colleagues at cornell university found in their study that kids who experienced the greatest increase in greenness as result of family move made the most gains on standard test of attention using nature to improve focus of attention ought to pay off academically and it seems to according to study led by kenneth tanner head of the school design planning laboratory at the university of georgia tanner and his team found that students in classrooms with unblocked views of at least feet outside the window had higher scores on tests of vocabulary language arts and maths than did students whose classrooms primarily overlooked roads and parking lots recent study on room lighting design suggests that dim light helps people to loosen up if that is true generally keeping the light low during dinner or at parties could increase relaxation researchers of harvard medical school also discovered that furniture with rounded edges could help visitors relax so far scientists have focused mainly on public buildings we have very limited number of studies so we re almost looking at the problem through straw architect david allison says how do you take answers to very specific questions and make broad generalized use of them that s what we re all struggling with what does joan meyers levy focus on in her research light ceilings windows furniture the height of room s ceiling affects how people think the passage tells us that the shape of furniture may affect people s feelings lower ceilings may help improve students creativity children in dim classroom may improve their grades students in rooms with unblocked views may feel relaxed furniture with rounded edges could help visitors relax the underlined sentence in the last paragraph probably means that the problem is not approached step by step the researches so far have faults in themselves the problem is too difficult for researchers to detect research in this area is not enough to make generalized patterns we have very limited number of studies how do you take answers to very specific questions and make broad generalized use of hem which of the following shows the organization of the passage cp central point p point sp sub point conclusion societies all over the world name places in similar ways quite often there is no official naming ceremony but places tend to be called names as points of reference by people then an organized body steps in and gives the place name frequently it happens that place has two names one is named by the people and the other by the government as in many areas old habits die hard and the place continues to be called by its unofficial name long after the meaning is lost many roads and places in singapore are named in order that the pioneers will be remembered by future generations thus we have names such as stamford road and raffles place this is in keeping with traditions in many countries in both the west and the east another way of naming places is naming them after other places perhaps they were named to promote friendships between the two places or it could be that the people who used to live there were originally from the places that the roads were named after the mystery is clearer when we see some of the roads named in former british bases if you step into selector airbase you will see piccadilly circus obviously named by some homesick royal air force personnel some places were named after the activities that used to go on at those places bras basah road is an interesting example bras basah means wet rice in malay now why would anyone want to name road wet rice road the reason is simple during the pioneering days wet rice was laid out to dry along this road few roads in singapore are named by their shapes there is circular road for one other roads may have part of their names to describe their shapes like paya lebar crescent this road is called crescent because it begins on the main road makes crescent and comes back to join the main road again we learn from paragraph that the government is usually the first to name place many places tend to have more than one name ceremony will be held when place is named people prefer the place names given by the government frequently it happens that place has two names one is named what does the underlined phrase die hard in paragraph probably mean change suddenly change significantly disappear mysteriously disappear very slowly die hard and the place continues to be called by its unofficial name long after the meaning is lost die hard which of the following places is named after person raffles place selector airbase piccadilly circus paya lebar crescent pioneers raffles place bras basah road is named after person after place after an activity by its shape bras basah what can be inferred from the passage some place names in singapore are the same as in britain some places in singapore are named for military purposes the way singaporeans name their places is unique young singaporeans have forgotten the pioneers piccadilly circus successful people in international business understand the cultures of other countries and learn to change their practices in different cultures they understand the importance of avoiding business decisions based on misconceptions mistaken ideas one cause of misconceptions is ethnocentrism the belief that one s own culture s way of doing things is better than the way of other cultures it s ethnocentrism that leads to failure in international business to avoid ethnocentrism it s necessary to study the different elements of culture language values and attitudes and customs and manners language knowledge of the local language can help international business people in four ways first people can communicate directly second people are usually more open in their communication with someone who speaks their language third an understanding of the language allows people to infer meanings that are not said directly finally knowing the language helps people to understand the culture better values and attitudes values are people s basic beliefs about the difference between right and wrong good and bad an attitude is way of thinking or acting values and attitudes influence international business for example many people in the united states believe that chocolate from switzerland is better than chocolate from other countries and they buy lot of it customs and manners customs are common social practices manners are ways of acting that the society believes are polite for example in the united states it is the custom to have salad before the main course at dinner not after it s not acceptable to talk with food in mouth at table failure to understand the customs and manners of other countries will bring difficulty selling their products orange juice as breakfast drink of an american company in france doesn t sell well because the french don t usually drink juice with breakfast knowledge of the local language allows international business people to be more open with their customers to communicate without outside help to express their thoughts indirectly to have better idea of their own culture first people can communicate directly the act of many people buying chocolate of switzerland shows the role of manners values attitudes customs values and attitudes an attitude is way of thinking or acting what would be the best title for the text misconceptions in business basic beliefs in business international business culture successful international business the author s purpose of writing this article is to tell people how to take right attitude in business how to avoid misunderstandings in business how to use local language in business how to act politely and properly in business get your hands off me i have been stolen the laptop portable computer shouted that is new solution to laptop computer theft program that lets owners give their property voice when it has been taken the program allows users to display alerts on the missing computer s screen and even to set spoken message tracking software for stolen laptops has been on the market for some time but this is thought to be the first that allows owners to give the thief piece of their mind owners must report their laptop missing by visiting website which sends message to the model red and yellow lost or stolen sign appears on its screen when it is started under the latest version of the software users can also send spoken message the message can be set to reappear every seconds no matter how many times the thief closes it one customer sent message saying you are being tracked i am right at your door said carrie hafeman chief executive of the company which produces the program retriever in the latest version people can add spoken message for example the laptop s speakers will say help this laptop is reported lost or stolen if you are not my owner report me now the retriever software package which costs but has free trial period has the functions of many security software programs owners can remotely switch to an alternative password if they fear that the thief has also got hold of the access details if thief accesses the internet with the stolen laptop retriever will collect information on the internet service provider in use so that the police can be alerted to its location thousands of laptops are stolen every year from homes and offices but with the use of laptops increasing the number stolen while their owners are out and about has been rising sharply other security software allows users to erase data remotely or lock down the computer the expression to give the thief piece of their mind can be understood as to give the thief an alert mind to express the owners anger to the thief to remind the thief of his conscience to make the thief give up his mind get your hands off me i have been stolen you are being tracked i am right at your door different from other security software retriever can record the stealing process help recognize the lost laptop lock down the computer remotely send spoken message in the latest version people call add spoken message recognize one function of the program is that it allows the owner to at distance change some access details for switching on the laptop turn on the laptop by using the original password operate the laptop by means of an alternative password erase the information kept in the stolen laptop owners can remotely switch to an alternative password if they fear that the thief has also got hold of the access details which of the following can best summarize the main idea of the passage with no retriever thousands of laptops are stolen every year new software provides means to reduce laptop theft retriever has helped to find thieves and lost computers new program offers communication platform with the thief timetable mondays to fridays oxforadlondon paddington oxford london paddington oxford london paddington

the findings coupled with widening range of scientific and historical research could add fascinating new page to the epic of the silk road the latest and most surprising discovery is pieces of silk found in the hair of an egyptian mummy from about bc long before regular traffic on the silk road and at least one thousand years before silk was previously thought to be used in egypt other research may extend human activity along this route back even further perhaps million years to the migration of human ancestors into eastern asia the official origin of eastwest commerce along the road is usually placed in the late nd century bc when an agent of the chinese emperor wudi returned from dangerous secret mission across the western desert into the remote high country of central asia the agent zhang qian travelled as far as afghanistan and brought back knowledge of even more distant lands such as persia syria and place known as lijien perhaps rome historians have called this one of the most important journeys in ancient times his journey opened the way for what have been thought to be the first indirect contacts between the ancient world s two superpowers china and rome chinese silk first traded to central asian tribes for war horses and to the parthians of old persia in exchange for acrobats and ostrich eggs was soon finding its way through network of merchants to the luxury markets of rome but the new discoveries show that chinese silk was apparently present in the west long before the han emperor started organized trade over the silk road the research could change thinking about the early history of world trade and provide insights into the mystery of just how and when europe and the mediterranean lands first became aware of the glorious culture at the other end of eurasia the word coupled in the first paragraph could best be replaced by produced continued doubled combined the silk thread found in the hair of an egyptian mummy suggests that egyptians had probably travelled to china to buy silk trade along the silk road began earlier than once thought historical research often achieves fascinating results new light can now be thrown on ancient trading practices until recently most historians believed that trade along the silk road originated in the nd century bc extended human migration into eastern asia began million years ago primarily benefited the egyptians historians have always considered zhang qian s mission important because they believe he brought back knowledge of rome to the emperor he discovered the silk road he helped establish eastwest trade he travelled as far as afghanistan the research could change thinking about the early history of world trade and provide insights into the mystery of just how and when europe and the mediterranean lands first became aware of the glorious culture at the other end of eurasia richardsolo rechargeable battery in just minutes day plug in and charge your iphone quickly

function shopping it is true that good writers rewrite and rewrite and then rewrite some more but in order to work up the desire to rewrite it is important to learn to like what you write at the early stage i am surprised at the number of famous writers i know who say that they so dislike reading their own writing later that they even hate to look over the publishers opinions one reason we may dislike reading our own work is that we re often disappointed that the rich ideas in our minds seem very thin and plain when first written down jerry fodor and steven pinker suggest that this fact may be result of how our minds work different from popular belief we do not usually think in the words and sentences of ordinary language but in symbols for ideas known as mentalese and writing our ideas down is an act of translation from that symbolic language but while mentalese contains our thoughts in the form of complex tapestry writing can only be composed one thread at time therefore it should not be surprising that our first attempt at expressing ideas should look so simple it is only by repeatedly rewriting that we produce new threads and connect them to get closer to the ideas formed in our minds when people write as if some strict critics are looking over their shoulder they are so worried about what this critic might say that they get stuck before they even start pierre elbow makes an excellent suggestion to deal with this problem when writing we should have two different minds at the first stage we should see every idea as well as the words we use to express it as wonderful and worth putting down it is only during rewrites that we should examine what we excitedly wrote in the first stage and check for weaknesses what do we learn from the text about those famous writers they often regret writing poor works some of them write surprisingly much many of them hate reading their own works they are happy to review the publishers opinions what do people generally believe about the way human minds work people think in words and sentences human ideas are translated into symbols people think by connecting threads of ideas human thoughts are expressed through pictures what can we conclude from the text most people believe we think in symbols loving our own writing is scientifically reasonable the writers and critics can never reach an agreement thinking and writing are different stages of mind at work i was in rush as always but this time it was for an important date i just couldn t be late for i found myself at checkout counter behind an elderly woman seemingly in no hurry as she paid for her groceries phd student with not lot of money i had hurried into the store to pick up some flowers i was in huge rush thinking of my upcoming evening i did not want to be late for this date we were in boston place not always known for small conversation between strangers the woman stopped unloading her basket and looked up at me she smiled it was nice smile warm and reassuring and i returned her gift by smiling back must be special lady whoever it is that will be getting those beautiful flowers she said yes she s special i said and then to my embarrassment the words kept coming out it s only our second date but somehow i am just having the feeling she s the one jokingly i added the only problem is that i can t figure out why she want to date guy like me well i think she s very lucky to have boyfriend who brings her such lovely flowers and who is obviously in love with her the woman said my husband used to bring me flowers every week even when times were tough and we didn t have much money those were incredible days he was very romantic and of course i miss him since he s passed away i paid for my flowers as she was gathering up her groceries there was no doubt in my mind as i walked up to her i touched her on the shoulder and said you were right you know these flowers are indeed for very special lady i handed her the flowers and thanked her for such nice conversation it took her moment to realize that i was giving her the flowers i had just purchased you have wonderful evening i said i left her with big smile and my heart warmed as i saw her smelling the beautiful flowers i remember being slightly late for my date that night and telling my girlfriend the above story couple of years later when i finally worked up the courage to ask her to marry me she told me that this story had helped to seal it for her that was the night that i won her heart why was the writer in hurry that day he was to meet his girlfriend he had to go back to school soon he was delayed by an elderly lady he had to pick up some groceries what does the underlined phrase her gift paragraph refer to her words her smile her flowers her politeness she smiled it was nice smile warm and reassuring her gift smile why did the writer give his flowers to the elderly lady she told him nice story she allowed him to pay first she gave him encouragement she liked flowers very much what is the message conveyed in the story flowers are important for date small talk is helpful love and kindness are rewarding elderly people deserve respecting we already know the fastest least expensive way to slow climate change use less energy with little effort and not much money most of us could reduce our energy diets by percent or more doing the earth favor while also helping our wallets not long ago my wife pj and i tried new diet not to lose little weight but to answer an annoying question about climate change scientists have reported recently that the world is heating up even faster than predicted only few years ago and that the consequences could be severe if we don t keep reducing emissions of carbon dioxide co and other greenhouse gases that are trapping heat in our atmosphere we decided to try an experiment for one month we recorded our personal emissions of co we wanted to see how much we could cut back so we went on strict diet the average us household produces about pounds of co day by doing common place things like turning on airconditioning or driving cars that s more than twice the european average and almost five times the global average mostly because americans drive more and have bigger houses but how much should we try to reduce for an answer i checked with tim flannery author of the weather makers how man is changing the climate and what it means for life on earth in his book he had challenged readers to make deep cuts in personal emissions to keep the world from reaching extremely important tipping points such as the melting of the ice sheets in greenland or west antarctica to stay below that point we need to reduce co emissions by percent he said good advice i thought i opened our bedroom windows to let in the wind we gotten so used to keeping our airconditioning going around the clock i almost forgotten the windows even opened we should not let this happen again it s time for us to change our habits if necessary co why did the author and his wife try new diet to take special kinds of food to respond to climate change to lose weight to improve their health not to lose little weight but to answer an annoying question about climate change the underlined words tipping points most probably refer to freezing points burning points melting points boiling points such as the melting of the ice sheets in greenland or west antarctica it can be inferred from the passage that it is necessary to keep the airconditioning on all the time it seems possible for every household to cut emissions of co the average us household produces about pounds of co month the average european household produces about pounds of co month which of the following would be the best title for this passage saving energy starts at home changing our habits begins at work changing climate sounds reasonable reducing emissions of co proves difficult it s only hours flying time from sydney but world away what better place to rest than country where the only place people hurry is on the football field and things are done in fiji time viti levu great fiji is the largest island here you ll find the capital suva and the international airport at nadi vatoa on the other hand is tiny island in the farthest part of fiji then there are other islands many of them with places to stay with less than million people living on islands you ll never feel crowded and with climate that changes only for five degrees between seasons there s never bad time to come from cities to villages from mountains to beaches from water sports to wooden artworks fiji can give you more adventures and special experiences than you could find almost anywhere in the world whenever you come wherever you go you re sure to see some unforgettable events from war dances to religious songs from market days to religious days it s not just staged for tourists it s still part of everyday life in fiji and any one of us can enjoy fiji s spirit by being part of the traditional sharing of yaqona drink made from the root of fiji plant so why not join us for the experience of lifetime fiji where is the international airport of fiji in suva in sydney on the island of vatoa on the island of viti levu fiji viti levu what does the text tell us about fijian people they invented fiji time for visitors they stick to traditional way of life they like to travel from place to place they love taking adventures abroad one of the things that make fiji tourist attraction is its comfortable hotels its good weather all year round its exciting football matches its religious beliefs where can we most probably read this text in personal diary in science report in travel magazine in geography textbook travel magazine when students and parents are asked to rate subjects according to their importance the arts are unavoidably at the bottom of the list music is nice people seem to say but not important too often it is viewed as mere entertainment but certainly not an education priority this view is shortsighted in fact music education is beneficial and important for all students music tells us who we are because music is an expression of the beings who create it it reflects their thinking and values as well as the social environment it came from rock music represents lifestyle just as surely as does schubert song the jazz influence that george gershwin and other musicians introduced into their music is obviously american because it came from american musical traditions music expresses our character and values it gives us identity as society music provides kind of perception that cannot be acquired any other way science can explain how the sun rises and sets the arts explore the emotive meaning of the same phenomenon we need every possible way to discover and respond to our world for one simple but powerful reason no one way can get it all the arts are forms of thought as powerful in what they communicate as mathematical and scientific symbols they are ways we human beings talk to each other they are the language of civilization through which we express our fears our curiosities our hungers our discoveries our hopes the arts are ways we give form to our ideas and imagination so that they can be shared with others when we do not give children access to an important way of expressing themselves such as music we take away from them the meanings that music expresses science and technology do not tell us what it means to be human the arts do music is an important way we express human suffering celebration the meaning and value of peace and love so music education is far more necessary than people seem to realize according to paragraph students regard music as way of entertainment disagree with their parents on education view music as an overlooked subject prefer the arts to science too often it is viewed as mere entertainment in paragraph the author uses jazz as an example to compare it with rock music show music identifies society introduce american musical traditions prove music influences people s lifestyles the jazz influence is obviously american because it came from american musical traditions it gives us identity as society according to the passage the arts and science approach the world from different angles explore different phenomena of the world express people s feelings in different ways explain what it means to be human differently they are ways we human beings talk to each other what is the main idea of the passage music education deserves more attention music should be of top education priority music is an effective communication tool music education makes students more imaginative camping wild is wonderful way to experience the natural world and at its best it makes little environmental influence but with increasing numbers of people wanting to escape into the wilderness it is becoming more and more important to camp unobtrusively and leave no mark wild camping is not permitted in many places particularly in crowded lowland britain wherever you are find out about organizations responsible for managing wild spaces and contact them to find out their policy on camping and shelter building for example it is fine to camp wild in remote parts of scotland but in england you must ask the landowner s permission except in national parks camping is about having relaxation sleeping outdoors experiencing bad weather and making do without modern conveniences busy fullyequipped campsite seems to go against this so seek out smaller more remote places with easy access to open spaces and perhaps beaches better still find campsite with no road access walking in makes real adventure finding the right spot to camp is the first step to guaranteeing good night s sleep choose campsite with privacy and minimum influence on others and the environment try to use an area where people have obviously camped before rather than creating new spot when camping in woodland avoid standing dead trees which may fall on windy night avoid animal runs and caves and possible homes of biting insects make sure you have most protection on the windward side if you make fire do so downwind of your shelter always consider what influence you might have on the natural world avoid damaging plants good campsite found not made changing it should be unnecessary you needn t ask for permission when camping in national parks in england most parts of scotland crowded lowland britain most parts of england but in england you must ask the landowner s permission except in national parks the author thinks that good campsite is one with easy access used previously with modern conveniences far away from beaches better still find campsite with no road access camping is about having relaxation sleeping outdoors experiencing bad weather and making do without modern conveniences seek out smaller more remote places with easy access to open spaces and perhaps beaches the last paragraph mainly deals with protecting animals building campfire camping in woodland finding campsite with privacy when camping in woodland avoid standing dead trees the passage is mainly about the protection of campsites the importance of wild camping the human influence on campsites the dos and don ts of wild camping western new bridge library announcement shortened

relevant books sunday is more like monday than it used to be places of business that used to keep daytime business hours are now open late into the night and on the internet the hour of the day and the day of the week have become irrelevant half century ago in the united states most people experienced strong and precise dividing lines between days of rest and days of work school time and summer time today the boundaries still exist but they seem not clear the law in almost all states used to require stores to close on sunday in most it no longer does it used to keep the schools open in all seasons except summer in most it still does and whether the work week should strengthen its legal limits or whether it should become more flexible is often debated how should we as society organize our time should we go even further in relaxing the boundaries of time until we live in world in which every minute is much like every other these are not easy questions even to ask part of the difficulty is that we rarely recognize the law of time even when we meet it face to face we know as children that we have to attend school certain number of hours certain number of days certain number of years but unless we meet the truant officer we may well think that we should go to school due to social custom and parents demand rather than to the law as adults we are familiar with extra pay for overtime working but less familiar with the fact that what constitutes overtime is matter of legal definition when we turn the clock forward to start daylightsaving time have we ever thought to ourselves here is the law in action as we shall see there is lot of law that has great influence on how we organize and use time compulsory education law overtime law and daylightsaving law as well as law about sunday closing holidays being late to work time zones and so on once we begin to look for it we will have no trouble finding law of time to examine and assess sunday is more like monday than it used to be by saying sunday is more like monday that it used to be the writer means that work time is equal to rest time many people have day off on monday it is hard for people to decide when to rest the line between work time and rest time is unclear sunday is more like monday than it used to be the author raises the questions in paragraph to introduce the fact that people fail to make full use of their time enjoy working overtime for extra pay are unaware of the law of time welcome flexible working hours according to the passage most children tend to believe that they go to school because they need to acquire knowledge have to obey their parents need to find companions have to observe the law we know as children that we have to attend school certain number of hours certain number of days certain number of years but unless we meet the truant officer we may well think we should go to school due to social custom and parents demand rather than the law what is the main idea of the passage our life is governed by the law of time how to organize time is not worth debating new ways of using time change our society our time schedule is decided by social customs last week my youngest son and i visited my father at his new home in tucson arizona he moved there few years ago and i was eager to see his new place and meet his friends my earliest memories of my father are of tall handsome successful man devoted to his work and family but uncomfortable with his children as child i loved him as school girl and young adult i feared him and felt bitter about him he seemed unhappy with me unless i got straight s and unhappy with my boyfriends if their fathers were not as successful as he was whenever i went out with him on weekends i used to struggle to think up things to say feeling on guard on the first day of my visit we went out with one of my father s friends for lunch at an outdoor cafe we walked along that afternoon did some shopping ate on the street table and laughed over my son s funny facial expressions gone was my father s critical air and strict rules who was this person i knew as my father who seemed so friendly and interesting to be around what had held him back before the next day my dad pulled out his childhood pictures and told me quite few stories about his own childhood although our times together became easier over the years i never felt closer to him at that moment after so many years i m at last seeing another side of my father and in so doing i m delighted with my new friend my dad in his new home in arizona is back to me from where he was why did the author feel bitter about her father as young adult he was silent most of the time he was too proud of himself he did not love his children he expected too much of her he seemed unhappy with me unless i got straight s and unhappy with my boyfriends if their fathers were not as successful as he was when the author went out with her father on weekends she would feel nervous sorry tired safe whenever i went out with him on weekends i used to struggle to think up things to say feeling on guard on guard what does the author think of her father after her visit to tucson more critical more talkative gentle and friendly strict and hardworking the underlined words my new friend in the last paragraph refer to the author s son the author s father the friend of the author s father the caf owner new friend tucson celebrity has become one of the most important representatives of popular culture fans used to be crazy about specific film but now the public tends to base its consumption on the interest of celebrity attached to any given product besides fashion magazines have almost abandoned the practice of putting models on the cover because they don t sell nearly as well as famous faces as result celebrities have realized their unbelievably powerful market potential moving from advertising for others products to developing their own celebrity clothing lines aren t completely new phenomenon but in the past they were typically aimed at the ordinary consumers and limited to few tv actresses today they re started by firstclass stars whose products enjoy equal fame with some world top brands the most successful startups have been those by celebrities with specific personal style as celebrities become more and more experienced at the market they expand their production scale rapidly covering almost all the products of daily life however for every success story there s related warning tale of celebrity who overvalued his consumer appeal no matter how famous the product s origin is if it fails to impress consumers with its own qualities it begins to resemble an exercise in selfpromotional marketing and once the initial attention dies down consumer interest might fade loyalty returning to triedandtrue labels today celebrities face even more severe embarrassment the popcultural circle might be bigger than ever but its rate of turnover has speeded up as well each misstep threatens to reduce celebrity s shelf life and the same newspaper or magazine that once brought him fame has no problem picking him to pieces when the opportunity appears still the ego s potential for expansion is limitless having already achieved great wealth and public recognition many celebrities see fashion as the next frontier to be conquered as the saying goes success and failure always go hand in hand their success as designers might last only short time but fashionlike celebrityhas always been temporary fashion magazines today seldom put models on the cover no longer put models on the cover need not worry about celebrities market potential judge the market potential of every celebrity correctly fashion magazines have almost abandoned the practice of putting models on the cover change in the consumer market can be found today that price rather than brand name is more concerned producers prefer models to celebrities for advertisements producers prefer tv actresses to film stars for advertisements quality rather than the outside of products is more concerned the underlined sentence in paragraph indicates that any wrong step will possibly decrease the popularity of celebrity and the sales of his products damage the image of celebrity in the eyes of the general public cut short the artistic career of celebrity in show business influence the price of celebrity s products the passage is mainly about celebrity and personal style celebrity and market potential celebrity and fashion design celebrity and clothing industry having husband means an extra seven hours of housework each week for women according to new study for men getting married saves an hour of housework week it s wellknown pattern said lead researcher frank stafford at university of michigan s institute for social research men usually work more outside the home while women take on more of the housework he points out that differences among households exist but in general marriage means more housework for women and less for men and the situation gets worse for women when they have children stafford said overall times are changing in the american home in women busied themselves with weekly hours of sweepinganddusting work compared with hours in men are taking on more housework more than doubling their housework hours from six in to in single women in their s and s did the least housework about weekly hours while married women in their s and s did the most about hours week men showed somewhat different pattern with older men picking up the broom more often than younger men single men worked the hardest around the house more than that of all other age groups of married men having children increases housework even further with more than three children for example wives took on more of the extra work clocking about hours week compared with husbands hours according to the wellknown pattern in paragraph married man takes on heavier work does more housework is the main breadwinner is the master of the house how many hours of housework did men do every week in the s about about about about what kind of man is doing most housework according to the text an unmarried man an older married man younger married man married man with children what can we conclude from stafford s research marriage gives men more freedom marriage has effects on job choices housework sharing changes over time having children means doubled housework you re sitting on the train home and the person opposite you yawns suddenly you re yawning with him though you re not tired this phenomenon confused scientists for years until recent study found that people tend to sympathize with fellow humans supporting this claim was the discovery that those children who were unable to form normal emotional ties with others did not experience contagious yawning which showed that humans communicate regularly without words hugo critchley neuroscientist has conducted an experiment recently which will prove that happiness and sadness can spread like the common cold according to critchley our mind and body are in constant exchange about how we re feeling emotions are closely linked with states of internal responses he explained there are also more visible changes in our gestures and facial expressions when we re in group these signals can spread to another person for example there s the obvious tendency to smile when smiled at and there are less obvious changes that reflect emotions of surprise anger or sadness such as change in our heart rate and blood pressure hugo critchley further explained our bodies synchronise and when we like the other person we even copy his behavior next time you chat with friend take note of how you re sitting it s pretty likely that you will be the same scientists believe it s our way of telling each other that we re partners through body language humans give each other very subtle but clear signals that show emotions so what lessons can we learn from this spend time with happy people otherwise your health could suffer said critchley when we re sad our body goes into fight or flight mode but when we re happy our body works normally and we feel relaxed and positive so we look bright our skin glows we feel healthy and it affects everyone around us according to hugo critchley emotions are as visible as facial expressions we yawn more frequently when we have cold emotions are connected with states of internal responses the change of blood pressure is not linked with the change of emotions emotions are closely linked with states of internal responses there are also more visible changes in our gestures and facial expressions the underlined word synchronise in paragraph means move slowly change rapidly relax temporarily respond accordingly synchronise when we like the other person we even copy his behavior from the passage we can learn sadness is as contagious as happiness anger is less contagious than friendliness surprise is more contagious than smile surprise is the most contagious among emotions for example there s the obvious tendency to smile when smiled at and there are less obvious changes that reflect emotions of surprise anger or sadness such as change in our heart rate and blood pressure which of the following statements is true according to the passage emotions have delicate influence on fellow humans children like copying the actions of fellow humans scientists are still confused about contagious yawning people tend to communicate more with body language recent study while showing generally positive attitude toward science also suggests widespread worry that it may be running out of control this idea is dangerous science can be force for evil as well as for good its applications can be channeled either way depending on our decisions the decisions we make personally or collectively will determine the outcomes of science but here is real danger science is advancing so fast and is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference and rather than fighting for the best possible policies we may step back and do nothing some people go even further they say that despite the moral and legal objections whatever is scientifically possible will be done somewhere sometime they believe that science will get out of control in the end this belief is dangerous too because it fuels sense of hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build safer world in our interconnected world the lack of agreement in and out of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science without common understanding the challenges of controlling science in this century will be really tough take human cloning for example despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact on traditional moral values some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques the outcomes are hard to predict therefore discussions on how science is applied should be extended far beyond scientific societies only through the united efforts of people with hope can we be fully safe against the misuse of science and can science best serve mankind in the future what can we conclude from the recent study people think highly of science people hold mixed opinions about science science is getting dangerously out of control science is used for both good and bad purposes according to the passage what will happen if we hold that science is getting beyond control the development of science will hopelessly slow down businesses will have even greater influence on science the public will lose faith in bringing about bright future people will work more actively to put science under control the discussion should reach beyond scientific societies because scientists have failed to predict the outcomes the ties between different areas need strengthening united efforts are necessary for the development of science people need to work together to prevent the bad use of science what is the main idea of the passage science and its applications bring us many dangers the development of science mostly lies in people s attitudes mankind can largely take control of science with their efforts the future of science will be influenced by the dangerous ideas science is advancing so fast and is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference so that that whatever despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact on traditional moral values some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques agreement on impact on according to review of evidence in medical journal runners live three years long than non runners you don have to run fast or for long see the benefit you may drink smoke be overweight and still reduce your risk of die early by running while running regularly can make you live forever the review says it be more effective at lengthening life walking cycling or swimming two of the authors of the review also made study published in showed mere five to minutes day of running reduced the risk of heart disease and early deaths from all cause the best exercise is one that you enjoy and will do but otherwise it probably running to avoid knee pain you can run on soft surfaces do exercises to strength your leg muscles avoid hills and get good running shoes running is cheap easy and it always energy if you are time poor you need run for only half the time to get the same benefits as other sports so perhaps we should all

production has jumped nearly percent over past years while rice has increased only percent taste for meat is actual behind the change an important part of its corn is used to feed chickens pigs and cattle another reason for corn rise the government encourages farmers to grow corn instead of rice improve water quality corn uses less water rice and creates less fertilizer runoff this switch has

mountains the sun was setting when my car break down near remote and poor village cursing my misfortune was wondering where was going to spend the night when realized that the villagers who had gathered around me were arguing as to should have the honor of receiving me guest in their house finally accepted the offer of an old woman who lived alone in little house while she was getting me settle into tiny but clean room the head of the village was tying up his horse to my car to pull it to small town some kilometres away there was garage had noticed three hens running free in my hostess courtyard and that night one of them ended up in dish on my table villagers brought me goat cheese and hone we drank together and talked merry till far into the night when the time came for me to say goodbye to my friends in the village wanted to reward the old woman the trouble had caused how should one invest sum of money in these clays of inflation left in bank it will hardly keep its value however high the interest rate only brave man or very rich one dares to buy and sell on the stock market today it seems that one of the best ways to protect your savings and even increase your wealth is to buy beautiful objects from the past here am going to offer some advice on collecting antique clocks which personally consider are among the most interesting of antiques sometimes wonder what being from another planet might report back about our way of life the planet earth is ruled by mysterious creature that sits or stands in room and makes strange ticking sound it has face with twelve black marks and two hands men can do nothing without its permission and it fastens its young round people wrists so that everywhere men go they are still under its control this creature is the real master of earth and men are its slaves whether or not we are slaves of time today depends on our culture and personality but it is believed that many years ago kings kept special slaves to tell the time certain men were very clever at measuring the time of clay according to the beating of their own hearts they were made to stand in fixed place and every hour or so would shout tire time so it seems that the first clocks were human beings however men quickly found more convenient and reliable ways of telling the time they learned to use the shadows cast by the sun they marked the hours on candles used sand in hour glasses and invented water clocks indeed any serious student of antique should spend as much time as possible visiting palaces stately homes and museums to see some of the finest examples of clocks from the past antique clocks could be very expensive but one of the joys of collecting clocks is that it is still possible to find quite cheap ones for your own home after all if you are going to be ruled by time why not invest in air antique clock and perhaps make future profit according to the passage collecting antique clocks can hardly keep the value of your savings will cost much of your savings may increase your wealth needs your bravery by quoting the remark of being from another planet the author intends to suggest human beings are controlled by clock describe why clocks can rule the planet earth tell readers what clocks look like compare chicks to human beings which of the following is not mentioned as way to measure the time counting the beating of one own heart making use of candles sand and water observing shadows cast by the sun keeping slaves busy day and night the underlined phrase stately homes in paragraph means state owned houses houses in very good condition grand houses open to the public houses where statesmen meet regularly the purpose of the passage is to introduce the culture of antique clocks to offer some advice on collecting antique clocks to compare different ways to make future profit to explain convenient and reliable ways of telling time do you want to live with strong sense of peacefulness happiness goodness and self respect the collection of happiness actions broadly categorized as honor help you create this life of good feelings here an example to show how honorable actions create happiness say store clerk fails to charge us for an item if we keep silent and profit from the clerk mistake we would drive home with sense of sneaky excitement later we might tell our family or friends about our good fortune on the other hand if we tell the clerk about the uncharged item the clerk would be grateful and thank us for our honesty we would leave the store with quiet sense of honor that we might never share with another soul then what is it to do with our sense of happiness in the first case where we don tell the clerk couple of things would happen deep down inside we would know ourselves as type of thief in the process we would lose some peace of mind and self respect we would also demonstrate that we cannot lie trusted since we advertise our dishonor by telling our family and friends we damage our own reputations by telling others in contrast bringing the error to the clerk attention causes different things to happen immediately the clerk knows us to be honorable upon leaving the store we feel honorable and our self respect is increased whenever we take honorable action we gain the deep internal rewards of goodness and sense of nobility there is beautiful positive cycle that is created by living life of honorable actions honorable thoughts lead to honorable actions honorable actions lead us to happier existence and it easy to think and act honorably again when we re happy while the positive cycle can be difficult to start once it started it easy to continue keeping on doing good deeds brings us peace of mind which is important for our happiness according to the passage the positive action in the example contributes to our self respect financial rewards advertising ability friendly relationship the author thinks that keeping silent about the uncharged item is equal to lying stealing cheating advertising the phrase bringing the error to the clerk attention in para means telling the truth to the clerk offering advice to the clerk asking the clerk to be more attentive reminding the clerk of the charged item how will we feel if we let the clerk know her mistake we ll be very excited we ll feel unfortunate we ll have sense of honor we ll feel sorry for the clerk which of the following can be the best title of this passage how to live truthfully importance of peacefulness ways of gaining self respect happiness through honorable actions malaria the world most widespread parasitic disease kills as many as three million people every year almost all of whom are under five very poor and african in most years more than five hundred million cases of illness result from the disease although exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don or can seek care it is not unusual for family earning less than two hundred dollars year to spend quarter of its income on malaria treatment and what they often get no longer works in countries like tanzania mozambique and the gambia no family village hospital or workplace can remain unaffected for long malaria starts suddenly with violent chills which are soon followed by an intense fever and often headaches as the parasites multiply they take over the entire body malaria parasites live by eating the red blood cells they infect they can also attach themselves to blood vessels in the brain if it doesn kill you malaria can happen again and again for years the disease passed on to humans by female mosquitoes infected with one of four species of parasite together the mosquito and the parasite are the most deadly couple in the history of the earth and one of the most successful malaria has five thousand genes and its ability to change rapidly to defend itself and resist new drugs has made it nearly impossible to control studies show that mosquitoes are passing on the virus more frequently and there are more outbreaks in cities with large populations some of the disease spread is due to global warming for decades the first choice treatment for malaria parasites in africa has been chloroquine chemical which is very cheap and easy to make unfortunately in most parts of the world malaria parasites have become resistant to it successful alternatives that help prevent resistance are already available but they have been in short supply and are very expensive if these drugs should fail nobody knows what would come next according to paragraph many people don seek care because they are too poor it is unusual to seek care they can remain unaffected for long there are too many people suffering from the disease people suffering from malaria have to kill female mosquitoes have ability to defend parasites have their red blood cells infected have sudden fever followed by chills which of the following may be the reason for the wide spread of the disease its resistance to global warming its ability to pass on the virus frequently its outbreaks in cities with large populations its ability to defend itself and resist new drugs it can be inferred from the passage that no drugs have been found to treat the disease the alternative treatment is not easily available to most people malaria has developed its ability to resist parasites nobody knows what will be the drug to treat the disease which of the following questions has not been discussed in the passage how can we know one is suffering from malaria how many people are killed by malaria each year why are there so many people suffering from malaria what has been done to keep people unaffected for long may gentleman the enclosed advertisement for your organization comes from the april issue of

that appear in disney films and in some folktales they are and cause much human suffering this is true in the tales about the changeling these tell the story of mother whose baby grows and pale and has changed so much that it is almost to the parents it was then that the fairies had come and stolen the baby away and the human baby with fairy changeling there were many ways to prevent this from happening hanging knife over the baby head while he slept or covering him with some of his father clothes were just two of the recommended however hope was not lost even if the baby had been in those cases there was often way to get the baby back you could the changeling on the fire then it would rise up the chimney and you would hear the sound of fairies laughter and soon after you would find your own child safe and sound nearby babies believers fairies supermen powerful cruel frightened extraordinary sick slim short small uncomfortable unbelievable unacceptable unrecognizable feared predicted heard reported covered changed replaced terrified cases tools steps methods missed stolen found lost ittle pale sad real seize burn place hold chinese proverbs are rich and they are still widely used in chinese people daily life these proverbs there are often interesting stories for example the proverb plucking up crop help it grow is based on the following story it is said that short tempered man in the song dynasty was very anxious to help rice crop grow up quickly he was thinking about day and night but the crop was growing much slower than he expected one day he came up with an idea he would pluck up all of his crop few inches he did so the next day he was very tired doing this for whole day he felt very happy since the crop did grow high his son heard about this and went to see the crop unfortunately the leaves of the crop began to wither this proverb is saying we have to let things go in their nature course being too anxious to help an event develop often result in the contrary to our intention parents and kids today dress alike listen to the same music and are friends is this good thing sometimes when mr ballmer and his year old daughter elizabeth listen to rock music together and talk about interests both enjoy such as pop culture he remembers his more distant relationship with his parents when he was teenager would never have said to my mom hey the new weezer album is really great how do you like it says ballmer there was just complete gap in taste music was not the only gulf from clothing and hairstyles to activities and expectations earlier generations of parents and children often appeared to move in separate orbits today the generation gap has not disappeared but it is getting narrow in many families conversations on subjects such as sex and drugs would not have taken place generation ago now they are comfortable and common and parent child activities from shopping to sports involve feeling of trust and friendship that can continue int adulthood no wonder greeting cards today carry the message to my mother my best friend but family experts warn that the new equality can also result in less respect for parents there still lot of strictness and authority on the part of parents out there but there is change happening says kerrie psychology professor at lebanon valley college in the middle of that change there is lot of confusion among parents family researchers offer variety of reasons for these evolving roles and attitudes they see the as turning point great cultural changes led to more open communication and more democratic process that encourages everyone to have say my parents were on the before side of that change but today parents the year olds were on the after side explains mr ballmer it not something easily accomplished by parents these days because life is more difficult to understand or deal with but sharing interests does make it more fun to be parent now the underlined word gulf in para most probably means interest distance difference separation which of the following shows that the generation gap is disappearing parents help their children develop interests in more activities parents put more trust in their children abilities parents and children talk more about sex and drugs parents share more interests with their children the change in today parent child relationship is more confusion among parents new equality between parents and children ess respect for parents from children more strictness and authority on the part of parents by saying today parents the year olds were on the after side the author means that today parents follow the trend of the change can set limit to the change fail to take the change seriously have little difficulty adjusting to the change the purpose of the passage is to describe the difficulties today parents have met with discuss the development of the parent child relationship suggest the ways to handle the parent child relationship compare today parent child relationship with that in the past sometimes you ll hear people say that you can love others until you love yourself sometimes you ll hear people say that you can expect someone else to love you until you love yourself either way you ve got to love yourself first and this can be tricky sure we all know that we re the apple of our parents eyes and that our grandmas think we re great talents and our uncle roberts think that we will go to the olympics but sometimes it lot harder to think such nice thoughts about ourselves if you find that believing in yourself is challenge it is time you build positive self image and learn to love yourself self image is your own mind picture of yourself this image includes the way you look the way you act the way you talk and the way you think interestingly our self images are often quite different from the images others hold about us unfortunately most of these images are more negative than they should be thus changing the way you think about yourself is the key to changing your self image and your whole world the best way to defeat passive self image is to step back and decide to stress your successes that is make list if you need to but write down all of the great things you do every day don allow doubts to occur in it it very well might be that you are experiencing negative self image because you can move past one flaw or weakness that you see about yourself well roll up your sleeves and make change of it as your primary task if you think you re silly because you aren good at math find tutor if you think you re weak because you can run mile get to the track and practice if you think you re dull because you don wear the latest trends buy few new clothes but remember just because you think it doesn mean it true the best way to get rid of negative serf image is to realize that your image is far from objective and to actively convince yourself of your positive qualities changing the way you

build positive self image when you dare to challenge yourself feel it hard to change yourself are unconfident about yourself have high opinion of yourself according to the passage our serf images have positive effects are probably untrue are often changeable have different functions how should you change your serf image according to the passage to keep different image of others to make your life successful to understand your own world to change the way you think what is the passage mainly about how to prepare for your success how to face challenges in your life how to build positive self image how to develop your good qualities who are the intended readers of the passage parents adolescents educators people in general napoleon as character in tolstoy war and peace is more than once described as having fat little hands nor does he sit well or firmly on the horse he is said to be undersized with short legs and round stomach the issue here is not the accuracy of tolstoy description it seems not that far off from historical accounts but his choice of facts other things that could be said of the man are not said we are meant to understand the difference of warring commander in the body of fat little frenchman tolstoy napoleon could be any man wandering in the streets and putting little of powdered tobacco up his nose and that is the point it is way the novelist uses to show the moral nature of character and it turns out that as tolstoy has it napoleon is crazy man in scene in book three of war and peace the wars having reached the critical year of napoleon receives representative from the tsar who has come with peace terms napoleon is very angry doesn he have more army he not the tsar is the one to make the terms he will destroy all of europe if his army is stopped that is what you will have gained by engaging me in the war he shouts and then tolstoy writes napoleon walked silently several times up and down the room his fat shoulders moving quickly still later after reviewing his army amid cheering crowds napoleon invites the shaken russian to dinner he raised his hand to the russian face tolstoy writes and taking him by the ear pulled it gently to have one ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court well well why don you say anything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to respect any one but himself napoleon tolstoy did his research but the composition is his own tolstoy description of napoleon in war and peace is far from the historical facts based on the russian history based on his selection of facts not related to historical details napoleon was angry when receiving the russian representative because he thought he should be the one to make the peace terms the tsar peace terms were hard to accept the russians stopped his military movement he didn have any more army to fight with what did napoleon expect the russian representative to do to walk out of the room in anger to show agreement with him to say something about the tsar to express his admiration tolstoy intended to present napoleon as man who is ill mannered in dealing with foreign guests fond of showing off his iron will determined in destroying all of europe crazy for power and respect what does the last sentence of the passage imply writer doesn have to be faithful to his findings writer may write about hero in his own way writer may not be responsible for what he writes writer has hardly any freedom to show his feelings the number one guide to what to study in the uk this two volume

do at work plus visitors on the way her parents were coming in for thanksgiving from her hometown but as she hurried down the subway stairs she started to feel uncomfortably warln by the time she got to the platform lisa felt weak and tired maybe it hadn been good idea to give blood the night before she thought she rested herself against post close to the tracks several yards away frank and his girlfriend jennifer found spot close to where the front of the train would stop they were deep in discussion about house they were thinking of buying but when he heard the scream followed by someone yelling oh my god she fell in frank didn hesitate he jumped down to the tracks and ran some feet toward the body lying on the rails no not you his girlfriend screamed after him she was right to be alarmed by the time frank reached lisa he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming the train was about seconds from the station it was hard to lift her she was just out but he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that by standers could hold her by the grins and drag her away from the edge that was where lisa briefly regained consciousness felt herself being pulled along the ground and saw someone else holding her purse lisa thought she been robbed woman held her hand and man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head and she tried to talk but she couldn and that was when she realized how much pain she was in police and fire officials soon arrived and frank told the story to an officer jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their minute train ride downtown just as he had been seconds after the rescue which made her think about her reaction at the time saw the train coming and was thinking he was going to die she explained what was the most probable cause for lisa weakness she had run long way she felt hot in the subway she had done ofwork she had donated blood the night before why did jennifer try to stop her boyfriend because they would miss their train because he didn see the train coming because she was sure lisa was hard to lifl because she was afraid the train would kill him how did frank save lisa by lifting her to the platform by helping her rise to her feet by pulling her along the ground by dragging her away from the edge when did lisa become conscious again when the train was leaving after she was back on the platform after the police and fire officials came when man was cleaning the blood from her head the passage is intended to warn us of the danger in the subway show us how to save people in the subway tell us about subway rescue report traffic accident we once had poster competition in our fifth grade art class you could win prizes our teacher told us as she wrote the poster information on the blackboard she passed out sheets of construction paper while continuing the first prize is ten dollars you just have to make sure that the words on the blackboard appear somewhere on your poster we studied the board critically some of us looked with one eye and held up certain colors against the blackboard rocking the sheets to the fight or left while we conjured up our designs others twisted their hair around their fingers or chewed their erasers while deep in thought we had plans for that ten dollar grand prize each and every one of us going to spend mine on candies one hopeful would announce while another practiced looking serious wise and rich everyone in the class made poster some of us used parts of those fancy paper napkins while others used nothing but colored construction paper some of us used big designs and some of us preferred to gather our art tidily down in one comer of our poster and let the space draw the viewer attention to it some of us would wander past the good students desks and then retum to our own projects with growing sense of hopelessness it was yet another grown up trick of the soil they seemed especially fond of making all of us believe we had fair chance and then always always rewarding the same old winners believe drew sailboat but can say that with any certainty made it admired it determined it to be the very best of all of the posters had seen and then turned it in minutes passed no one came along to give me the grand prize and then someone distracted me and probably never would have thought about that poster again was still sitting at my desk thinking what poster when the teacher gave me an envelope with ten dollar bill in it and everyone in the class applauded for me what was the teacher requirement for the poster it must appear in time it must be done in class it must be done on construction sheet it must include the words on the blackboard the underlined phrase in paragraph most probably means formed an idea for made an outline for made some space for chose some colors for after the teacher words all the students in the class ked very serious thought they would be rich began to think about their designs began to play games after seeing the good students designs some students ved their own designs more thought they had fair chance put their own designs in comer thought they would not win the prize we can infer from the passage that the author enjoyed grown up tricks very much ved poster competitions very much felt surprised to win the competition became wise and rich after the competition few years ago had an aha moment regarding handwriting had in my hand sheet of paper with handwritten instructions on it for some sort of editorial task it occurred at first that did not recognize the handwriting and then realized whose it must be finally became aware of the fact that had been working with this colleague for at least year maybe two and yet did not recognize her handwriting at that point it was very important event in the computerization of life sign that the informal friendly communication of people working together in an office had changed from notes in pen to instant messages and emails there was time when our workdays were filled with little letters and we recognized one another handwriting the way we knew voices or faces as child visiting my father office was pleased to recognize in little notes on the desks of his staff the same handwriting would see at home in the notes he would leave on the mdge except that those notes were signed dad instead of rfw all this has been on my mind because of the talk about the rise and fall of handwriting book by florey sire shows in her book deep coflceru about the fall of handwriting and the failure of schools to teach children to write well but many others argue that people in digital age can be expected to learn to hold pen don buy it don want to see anyone cut off from the expressive personal associations that pen still promotes better than digital keyboard does for many biographer part of really getting to know their subjects is learning to read their handwriting what some people advocate is teaching one of the many attractive handwritings based on the handwriting of th century italy that may sound impossibly grand as if they want kids to learn to draw by copying classical paintings however they have worked in many school systems why was the author surprised at not recognizing his colleague handwriting he had worked with his colleague long enough his colleague handwriting was so beautiful his colleague handwriting was so terrible he still had of work to people working together in an office used to talk more about handwriting take more notes on workdays know better one another handwriting pommlilnieatp bettpr with one anothp the author father wrote notes in pen to both his family and his staff to his family in small letters to his family on the fridge to his staft on the desk according to the author handwritten notes are harder to teach in schools attract more attention are used only between friends carry more message we can learn from the passage that the author thinks it impossible to teach handwriting does not want to lose handwriting puts the blame on the computer does not agree with florey this picture book explores the life of tree that has deep roots long arms and many children she provides shelter for many animals and bears fruit the author uses colorful simple yet detailed watercolor illustrations to convey her words the charming pictures show the many aspects in the life of tree down to the caterpillars that eat the leaves it is good for pre school children this charming picture book highlights the life of garden from planting seeds to harvesting with the narrator as guide the reader is led through variety of free verse and occasionally rhymed poems that fill in the story of garden and its inhabitants the pictures delightful watercolors in bright pastels add to the whimsical feel of the poems young readers will certainly joy this fun and fanciful text this is story from which introduces little boy who likes to go fishing with tree limb wonn and pin ahhough he never catches anything on this particular day he finally does hook three big ones but the little one gets away the boy pulls them home in his wagon and his mother cooks them for supper the swinging rhythms of the text and the good humor evident in the illustrations remain fun for the youngest readers this useful attractive oversize volume uses its height well employing tree metaphor to show the earth various kinds of life and how au living things from bacteria to the largest mammals are related each spread covers one branch of the animal kingdom to make the enormity of species understandable strauss equates individual species bacteria with one leaf on the tree this is story about how grandfather teaches his eager granddaughter to catch speckled trout from the stream in springtime after whole day on the lake only grandpa is lucky the next morning the young fisherman hurries to the dock alone and soon she hooks the catch of lifetime young readers will appreciate this story that celebrates the special bond between the older and younger generation while brilliant watercolor illustrations capture the beauty of the natural world eye doctor short sighredness jackie is perhaps the most easily annoyed koala at the featherdale wildlife park in southern australia all the koalas there are unhappy and complaining you would be too if you were used to night activities and someone kept waking you up all day while you were trying to sleep it off that right sleep it off the average koala is always half asleep because it feeds on the leaves of special kind that makes it sleepy the reason jackie and her fellow koalas are repeatedly awoken from their deep sleep is so they can be hugged and photographed by tourists who make the trips to featherdale and an increasing number of other national parks for just that special experience whatever department in the aussie government in charge of such things is now moving to make the practice illegal which is understandable how would you react my friend if you were trying to sleep off dozen times and some round furry creature smelling of grass kept waking you cbcaa dcadb badbc adcbd it to please pushed where choices on him at was informed ddabc dacdc acadb acdcd abbcd dbdac eadfc fcabe last weekend had an interview with professor wang an eye doctor concerning the issue of short sightedness of school children in china according to professor wang slightly more than half of the school children in our country are short sighted ranking the first in the world he also pointed out that the causes for short sightedness are so complicated that no medicine can cure short sightedness he suggested that school children avoid overuse of their eyes and do more out door activities he particularly reminded us that how to hold pen is also related to short sightedness should tourists take photos with animals koalas in wildlife parks can fall asleep because tourists keep disturbing them the movement is thinking to make the tourists behaviour illegal to protect the animals when people are visiting wildlife parks they like to take photographs with animals reasons for this are varied some people may think taking photos with animals are funny in contrast with taking photos with other persons others may think that it will be an interesting experience to take photos with animals during their visit if were an animal in the wildlife park would feel annoyed when people keep photographing with me my life would be greatly influenced and wouldn feel happy at all think should have some private space and time to relax myself however don agree if it is announced illegal to take photos with animals tourists pay for tickets to visit the wildlife park and it will be pity for them if they can have photo with an animal perhaps wildlife parks can set some special time during which tourists can take photos with animals it can both satisfy tourists and protect the animals ii abc every country has its own culture even though each country uses doors doors many have functions and purposes which lead to differences when first came to america noticed that public building had two different and they had distinct functions you have to push the door with the word push to go out of the building and to pull the door with the word pull to the building this was new to me because we use the door in south korea for quite few times failed to go out of shopping centre and was embarrassed the way of using school bus doors was also to me used to take the school bus to classes the school decided that when the driver opened both the front and back doors who were getting off the bus should get off first and students who were getting on should get on in south korea we do not need to wait for people to get off one morning hurried to the bus and when the bus doors opened tried to get on the school bus through the front door all the students around looked at me was totally and my face went red different important practical unusual national embarrassing cultural amazing exits entrances signs doors enter leave open close main same front back annoying hard satisfying strange parents students teachers drivers sooner later faster earlier politely patiently unconsciously slowly embarrassed annoyed unsatisfied excited young man while traveling through desert csme across spring of clear water water was sweet he filled his leather container so that he could bring some back to elder had been his teacher after four day journey the young man present the water to the old man his teacher took deep drink smiled warm and thanked his student very much for the sweet water the young man went home happy heart after the student left the teacher let student taste the water he spit it out say it was awful apparently it was no longer fresh because of the old leather container he asked his teacher sir the water was awful why did you pretend to like the teacher replied you tasted the water tasted the gift the water was simply the container for an act of kindness and love nothing could be sweet we understand this lesson best we receive gifts of love from children whether it is cheap pipe on diamond necklace the proper response is appreciation we love the idea within the gift rather than the thing when was growing up in america was ashamed of my mother chinese english because of her english she was often treated unfairly people in department stores at banks and at restaurants did not take her seriously did not give her good service pretended not to understand her or even acted as if they did not hear her my mother has realized the limitations of her english as well when was fifteen she used to have me call people on phone to pretend was she was forced to ask for information or even to yell at people who had been rude to her one time had to call her stockbroker said in qn adolescent voice that was not very convincing this is mrs tan and my mother was standing beside me whispering loudly why he don send me cheek already two week lone and then in perfect english said getting rather concerned you agreed to send the check two weeks ago but it hasn arrived then she talked more loudly what he want come to new york tell him front of his boss and so turned to the stockbroker again can tolerate any more excuse if don receive the check immediately am going to have to speak to your manager when am in new york next week the next week we ended up in new york while was sitting there red faced my mother the real mrs tan was shouting to his boss in her broken english when was tennager my mother broken english embarrassed me but now see it differently to me my mother english is perfectly clear perfectly natural it is my mother tongue her language as hear it is vivid direct and full of observation and visdom it was the language that helped shape the way saw things expressed ideas and made sense of the world why was the author mother poorly served she was unable to speak good english she was often misunderstood she was not clearly heard she was not very polite from paragorph we know that the author was good nretending rude to the stockbroker ready to help her mother unwilling to phone for her mother after the author made the phone call they forgave the stockbroker trrny failed to grt the check they went to new york immediately they spoke to their boss at once what does the author think of her mother english now it confuses her it embarrasses her it helps her understand the world it helps her tolerate rude people we can iraer from the passage that chinese english is clear and natural to non native peakers is vivid and direct to non native speakers has verv bad reputation in america may bring inconvenience in america when something goes wrong it can be very satisfying to say well it so and so fault or know late but it not my fault the car broke down it is probably not your fault but once you form the habit of blaming somebody or something else for bad situation you are loser yoa have no power and could do nothing that helps change the situation howevet you can have great power over what happens to you if you stop focusing on whom to blame and start focusing on how to remedy the situation this is the winner key to success winners are great at overcoming problems for example if you were late because your car broke down maybe you need to have your car examined more regularly or you might start to earry along with you the useful phone numbers so you could call for help when in need for another example if your colleague causes you problems on the job for lack of responsibility or ability find ways of dealing with his irresponsibility or inability rather than simply blame the person ask to work with different person or don rely on the person you should accept that the person ask to work with different person or don rely on this person you should accept that the person is not reliable and find creative ways to work successfully regardless of how your colleague fails to do his job well this is what being winner is all about creatively using your skills and talents so that you are successful no matter what happens winners don have fewer problems in their lives they have just as many difficult situations to face as anybody else they are just better at seeing those problems as challenges and opportunities to develop their own talents so stop focusing on whose fault it is once you are confident about your power over bad situations problems are just stepping stop on for success according to the passage winners deal with problems rather that blame others meet with fewer difficulties in their lives have responsible and able colleagues blame themselves rather that others the underlined word remedy in paragraph is closest in meaning to avoid accept improve consider when your colleague brings about problem you should find better way to handle the problem blame him for his lack of responsibility tell him to find the cause of the problem ask more able colleague for help when problems occur winners take them as excuses for their failures barriers to greater power challenges to their colleagues chances for self development which of the following is the best title for the passage winner secret winner problem winner opportunity winner achievement food hometimes gets poisoned with harmful things aperson who eats such food can get an illness called food poisoning food poisoning is usually not serious but some types are deadly the symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within hours of eating the poisoned food fever is one of the most common symptoms certain microorganisms cause most types of food poisoning becteria and other microorganisms man poison eggs meat vegetabies and many other foods after entering the body these tiny living things release poisons that make people sick some chemicals can also cause food poisoning they are often added to food while it is being grown processes or prepared for example many farmers spray chemicals on crops to kill weeds and in sects some people may have bad reaction to those chemicals when they eat the crops some plants and animals contain natural poisons that are harmful to people these include certain kinds of seafood grains nuts seeds beans and mushrooms when people handle food properly the risk of food poisoning is very small microorganisms multiply rapidly in dirty places and in warm temperatures this means that people should never touch food with dirty hands or put food on unwashed surfaces food should be kept in refrigerator to stop microorganisms from growing meat needs to be cooked thoroughly to kill any dangerous microorganisms people should also wash food covered with chemicals before eating it finally people should not eat wild mushrooms or other foods that grow in the wild some of these foods may contain natural materials that are poisonous to humans in addition some types of fish can be poisonous most people recover from food poisoning after few days of resting and drinking extra water if people eat natural poisons they must go to the hospital right away to have their stomachs emptied which of the following statements is not true food when poisoned can make people sick food poisoning means death food poisoning comes in varieties food poisoning can be serious we know from the passage that the symptoms of food poisoning are always accompanied by fever are too common to be noted can be noticed within hours can he ignored food poiseming can be caused by all the following except fome chemicals low temperatures some tiny living things certain naturall materials from paragraph we can learn that mushrooms should not be eaten vegetables are safer than meat and seafood natural poisons are more dangerous than chemicals different types of food should be handled differently it can be inferred from the passage that natural materials are safe in food processing chemicals are needed in food processing food poisoning can be kept under control food poisoning is out of control the debate has been raging for years over the safety of and necessity for

biggest he could find in recent years hundreds of schools have carried out experiments with paying kids with cash for showing up or getting good grades all school kids admire this trend but it upsets adults teachers say that we are rewarding kids for doing what they should be doing of their own will psychologists warn that money can actually make lies perform worse by making the act of learning cheap the debate has become typical hattle over why our kids are not learning at the rate they should be despite decades of reforms and budget increases ccdba abdab abadc later until sitting pretended mentally whom he on an all adbcb bccba acdba bbdad faedc it has been argued by some that gifted children should be grouped in special classes the has been on the belief that in regular classes these children are held back in their intellectual growth by situation that has designed for the children there can be little doubt that classes can help the gifted children to graduate earlier and take their place in life sooner however to take these out of the regular classes may create serious problems observed number of children who were taken out of special class and placed in class in the special class they showed little ability to use their own judgment relying on their teachers directions in the regular class having no worry about keeping up they began to reflect on many problems some of which were not on the school program many are concerned that gifted children become and lose interest in learning however this is more often from parents and teachers than from students and some of these simply conclude that special classes should be set up for those who are some top students do feel bored in class but why they so goes far beyond the work they have in school studies have shown that to be bored is to be anxious the gifted child who is bored is an child principle theory arguments classification designing grouping learning living smart curious mature average regular

ordinary one sunday morning in august went to local music festival left it early because had an appointment late that day my friends walked me to the bus stop and waited with me the bus arrived got on the bus and found seat near the back and then noticed man sit at the front he pretend that tiger toy was real and giving it voice he must be mental disabled behind him were other people to he was trying to talk but after some minutes walked away and sat near me looking annoyed didn want to be laughed at for talking to him but didn like leaving him his own either after while rose from my seat and walked to the front of the bus sat next to the man and introduced myself we had amazing conversation he got off the bus before me and felt very happy the rest of the way home glad made choice it made of us feel good in the animal kingdom weakness can bring about aggression in other animal this sometimes happens with humans also but have found that my weakness brings out the kindness in people see it every day when people hold doors for me pour cream into my coffee or help me to put on my coat and have discovered that it makes them happy from my wheelchair experience see the best in people but sometimes feel sad because those who appear independent miss the kindness see daily they don get to see this soft side of others often we try every way possible to avoid showing our weakness which includes lot of pretending but only when we stop pretending we re brave or strong do we allow people to show the kindness that in them last month when was driving home on busy highway began to feel unwell and drove more slowly than usual people behind me began to get impatient and angry with some speeding up alongside me horning or even shouting at me at the moment decided to do something had never done in twenty fore years of driving put on the car flashlights and drove on at really low speed no more angry shouts and no more horns when put on my flashlights was saying to other drivers have problem here am weak and doing the best can and everyone understood several times saw drivers who wanted to pass they couldn get around me because of the stream of passing traffic but instead of getting impatient and angry they waited knowing the driver in front of them was in some way weak sometimes situations call for us to act strong and brave even when we don feel that way but those are and far between more often it would be better if we don pretend we feel strong when we feel weak or pretend that we are brave when we are scared the author has discovered that people will feel happy when the offer their help they receive others help they feel others kindness they show their weakness the author feels sad sometimes because he has soft heart he relies much on others some people pretend to be kind some people fail to see the kindness in others what did the other drivers do when they saw the flashlights they speed up to pass they waited with patience they tried their best to help they put on their flashlights too in this passage the author advises us to handle problems by ourselves accept help from others admit our weakness show our bravery which of the following is the best title for the passage wheelchair experience weakness and kindness weakness and strength driving experience can dogs and cats live in perfect harmony in the same home people who are thinking about adopting dog as friend for their cats are worried that they will fight recent research has found new recipe of success according to the study if the cat is adopted before the dog and if they are introduced when still young less than months for cats year for dogs it is highly probable that the two pets will get along swimmingly two thirds of the homes interviewed reported positive relationship between their cat and dog however it wasn all sweetness and light there was reported coldness between the cat and dog in of the homes while aggression and fighting were observed in of the homes one reason for this is probably that some of their body signals were just opposite for example when cat turns its head away it signals aggression while dog doing the same signals submission in homes with cats and dogs living peacefully researchers observed surprising behavior they are learning how to talk each other language it is surprise that cats can learn how to talk dog and dogs can learn how to talk cat what interesting is that both cats and dogs have appeared to develop their intelligence they can learn how to read each other body signals suggesting that the two may have more in common than we previously suspected once familiar with each other presence and body language cats and dogs can play together greet each other nose to nose and enjoy sleeping together on the sofa they can easily share the same water bowl and in some cases groom each other the significance of the research on cats and dogs may go beyond pets to people who don get along including neighbors colleagues at work and even world superpowers if cats and dogs can learn to get along surely people have good chance the underlined word swimmingly in paragraph is closest in meaning to early sweetly quickly smoothly some cats and dogs may fight when they are cold to each other they look away from each other they misunderstood each other signals they are introduced at an early age what is found surprising about cats and dogs they eat and sleep each other they observe each other behaviors they learn to speak each other language they know something from each other voices it is suggested in paragraph that cats and dogs have common interests are less different than was thought have common body language are less intelligent than was expected what can we human beings learn from cats and dogs we should learn to live in harmony we should know more about animals we should live in peace with animals we should learn more body languages year after graduation was offered position teaching writing class teaching

father went by the same name and liked to imagine people getting the two of us confused wait minute someone might say are you talking about mr davis the retired man or mr davis the respectable scholar the position was offered at the last minute and was given two weeks to prepare period spent searching for briefcase and standing before my full length mirror repeating the words hello class mr davis sometimes would give myself an aggressive voice sometimes would sound experienced but when the day eventually came my nerves kicked in and the true mr davis was there sounded not like thoughtful professor but rather year old boy arrived in the classroom with paper cards designed in the shape of maple leaves had cut them myself out of orange construction paper saw nine students along long table handed out the cards and the students wrote down their names and fastened them to their breast pockets as required all right then said okay here we go then opened my briefcase and realized that had never thought beyond this moment had been thinking that the students would be the first to talk offering their thoughts and opinions on the events of the day had imagined that would sit at the edge of the desk overlooking forests of hands every student would yell calm down you ll all get your turn one at time one at time terrible silence ruled the room and seeing no other opinions inspected the students to pull out their notebooks and write brief essay related to the theme of deep disappointment the author took the job to teach writing because he wanted to be expected he had written some storied he wanted to please his father he had dreamed of being teacher what can we learn about the author from paragraph he would be aggressive in his first class he was well prepared for his first class he got nervous upon the arrival of his first class he waited long for the arrival of his first class before he started his class the author asked the students to write down their suggestions on the paper cards cut maple leaves out of the construction paper cut some cards out of the construction paper write down their names on the paper cards what did the students do when the author started his class they began to talk they stayed silent they raised their hands they shouted to be heard the author chose the composition topic probably because he got disappointed with his first class he had prepared the topic before class he wanted to calm down the students he thought it was an easy topic in world with limited land water and other natural resources the harm from the traditional business model is on the rise actually the past decades has seen more and more forests disappearing and globe becoming increasingly warm people now realize that this unhealthy situation must be changed and that we must be able to develop in sustainable ways that means growth with low carbon or development of sustainable products in other words we should keep the earth healthy while using its supply of natural resources today sustainable development is proper trend in many countries according to recent study the global market for low carbon energy will become three times bigger over the next decades china for example has set its mind on leading that market hoping to seize chances in the new round of the global energy revolution it is now tryuing hard to make full use of wind and solar energy and is spending huge amount of money making electric cars and high speed trains in addition we are also seeing great growth in the global markets for sustainable products such as palm oil which is produced without cutting down valuable rainforest in recent years the markets for sustainable products have grown by more than governments can fully develop the potential of these new markets first they can set high targets for reducing carbon emissions and targets for saving and reusing energy besides stronger arrangement of public resources like forests can also help to speed up the development finally governments can avoid the huge expenses that are taking us in the wrong direction and redirecting some of those expenses can accelerate the change from traditional model to sustainable one the major challenge of this century is to find ways to meet the needs of growing population within the limits if this single planet that is no small task but it offers abundant new chances for sustainable product industries the traditional business model is harmful because of all the following except that it makes the world warmer it consumes natural resources it brings severe damage to forests it makes growth hard to continue what can we infer from paragraph china lacks wind and solar energy china is the leader of the low carbon market high speed trains are low carbon development palm oil is made at the cost of valuable forests to full develop the low carbon markets government can cut public expenses forbid carbon emission develop public resources encourage energy conservation we can learn from the last paragraph that businesses have many chances to develop sustainable products explore new natural resources make full use of natural resources deal with the major challenge what is the main purpose of the passage to introduce new business model to compare two business models to predict change of the global market to advocate sustainable development when it come
